With new data protection laws coming into force next year and machine learning gaining pace it is time for marketers to get up to speed with developments in AI.
As we learned during the general election, political campaigns now routinely involve paid social advertising utilising a variety of data to identify likely supporters or swing voters.
Such ‘social scoring’, whether done manually or by an algorithm, is concerning to some. Professor John Rust of Cambridge University’s Psychometric Centre told the Guardian: “The danger of not having regulation around the sort of data you can get from Facebook and elsewhere is clear. With this, a computer can actually do psychology; it can predict and potentially control human behaviour.”
He finds it “incredibly dangerous” that people’s “attitudes are being changed behind their backs”.
User profiling is nothing novel. Dynamic pricing and credit rating, for example, may seem similarly unfair to many – identifying your mobile device or computer as an indicator of wealth, or your credit score as an indicator of financial concerns.
Consent is becoming a thorny issue and marketers everywhere need to understand what measures their data protection officers are putting into place.
Social scoring using public social media posts has been fair game for a while too, with employers and landlords checking for anything that may set off alarm bells. There are companies that will check private posts and messages for landlords too, taking advantage of the competitive property market to ask that prospective tenants sign up to handover access.
Such software cannot legally use factors such as age and pregnancy to determine suitability, but, as an article in Gawker explained, it can determine estimates of a tenant’s “extroversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness”.

The use of machine learning is ramping up quickly. IBM Watson offers a suite of off-the-shelf functionality and Google provides a whole range of APIs. Martech vendors are adding machine learning features and client-side companies are looking to employ data scientists to take advantage of their wealth of customer data.
Now is the perfect time for marketers to increase their understanding, not least because the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is due to come into force in May 2018, stipulating that processing of personal data must be “lawful, fair and transparent”.
There are many examples where this arguably isn’t the case. Harvard research suggests internet searches for “black-identifying” names generate advertisements associated with arrest records far more often than those for “white-identifying” names. Discrimination needs to be actively guarded against.
The Information Commissioner’s Office’s (ICO) advice on getting consumers’ consent for data processing argues that “informed trust” will give a competitive advantage and reduce the risk of backlash.
This might be tricky for AI. The ICO acknowledges analysing big data for unknown patterns involves “unpredictability by design” and that deep learning includes “inevitable opacity that makes it very difficult to understand the reasons for decisions made as a result”.
This is summed up nicely in a paper by Christopher Kuner et al: “In practice, how can informed consent be obtained in relation to a process that may be inherently non-transparent (a ‘black box’)?”
What’s clear is that more thought is needed in this area, with guidance on the GDPR’s ‘profiling’ provisions set to come from the ICO later in the year, as well as the commissioning of research into social scoring as it applies to employment, housing, finance etc.
These questions of transparent and fair data usage will of course only multiply. One only has to look at the impact of internet of things technology, such as tracking sensors in out-of-home advertising, to see what the eventual data landscape could look like.
Consent is becoming a thorny issue and marketers everywhere need to understand what measures their data protection officers are putting into place for the GDPR, and how that affects marketing workflow.

But we should not let the talk of profiling demonise the technology of machine learning. It is only as useful and as fair as data scientists enable it to be. What’s more, we shouldn’t forget that human decision making is fallible and often prejudiced.
In fact, Kuner et al propose that algorithmic processes have a role to play in a fairer society, suggesting “it may in future be feasible to use an algorithmic process to demonstrate the lawfulness, fairness, and transparency of a decision made by either a human or a machine to a greater extent than is possible via any human review of the decision in question”.
Robots as arbiters. An interesting thought.

The beauty giant’s chief digital officer believes “conversational artificial intelligence” (AI) will transform how brands interact with consumers.
L’Oréal has launched an artificial intelligence-powered Facebook Messenger bot as part of a drive to produce services for its beauty brands and learn more about consumers.
In partnership with startup Automat Technologies, the beauty giant has developed a series of beauty services that will launch in the coming months on the Facebook Messenger platform.
The first L’Oréal service, launching in Canada, will be a gifting service on the Messenger platform. The service looks to help consumers to find the right beauty box gift for their friends based on a series of questions that define their friend’s beauty profile and help consumers select the right brand and product mix at the right budget. The company says it hopes to launch the service in the UK early 2018.
Over the past two years, L’Oréal has embarked on a journey of digital transformation, in which it has aimed to build more services and products for its brands. Earlier this year it unveiled the ‘connected brush’, which uses algorithms to score the quality of the user’s hair and provides customised product recommendations.
The company’s chief digital officer Lubomira Rochet says the focus on Messenger bots is the latest iteration of its “service strategy”. L’Oréal believes conversational marketing and commerce in combination with AI will allow it to have more personalised conversations with its consumers, and in turn increase sales.
She tells Marketing Week: “I believe AI is as big a revolution as the internet itself. It’s going to power more of our interactions with our consumers, be it through advertising, CRM or even ad serving. All those compartments of marketing will be transformed by AI. It’s a great way to get more personalised than we’ve ever been.”
Conversation commerce is of particular interest to the cosmetics brand, as it allows consumers to be “more open and reveal much more about their preferences than they’d do by filling in a form on a website”.
I believe AI is as big a revolution as the internet itself. It’s going to power more of our interactions with our consumers, be it through advertising, CRM or even ad serving.
“When you are in conversation, it’s easier to reveal more about your preferences. As a result, it’s easier for the conversation to lead to a transaction,” adds Rochet. “The moment of truth between conversation and transaction will be shortened within platforms such as WhatsApp, Messenger or whatever new platform we’ll have.”
When asked whether there is a risk of Messenger bots being seen as nothing more than a gimmick, Rochet instantly refutes this claim. She says L’Oréal didn’t rush into launching a Facebook Messenger bot when its ad service came out last year and instead took a more patient approach.
“We did a ton of interviews with consumers as to what they’re expecting from bots. We wanted to provide a real service that people are waiting for, and not start a conversation bot for the sake of it. The platform is still very new, so we also benefited from watching other brands who launched their bots before us,” she says.
The Messenger bot is part of the company’s broader digital strategy, which is made up out of three pillars. Besides honing in on ecommerce, L’Oréal also looks to become a “data-focused” company and overhaul its marketing by focusing on content and influencers.

In 2016, its ecommerce business grew like-for-like sales 32%, with L’Oreal having “very strong ambitions” to further expand its online offering. Besides partnering with the likes of Boots, Sephora, Amazon and Alibaba, Rochet says the brand also wants its own ecommerce platform and try out new interfaces such as Messenger.
“Digital [is all about] creating a connection with consumers. By getting the right insight and products and by personalising our advertising, this whole value chain that digital has allowed us to create at scale has become the backbone of our marketing operations,” she adds.
That’s not to say that digital advertising has not had its drawbacks. An ongoing investigation by The Times found that ads from brands including L’Oréal had appeared next to extremist content. However, Rochet remains optimistic, and insists it has “long-standing relationships” with Google and Facebook and that it has put in place new safety guidelines following the scandal.
She concludes: “In terms of internet advertising, they have new rules and new pitfalls you need to be aware of. So we needed to train our media directors and marketers internally. As much as we had an issue in the UK, especially with Google, it’s something we’ve cleared up pretty fast and we now are very confident.”

“they have new rules and new pitfalls you need to be aware of.”
Like what?
It sounds as if AI is being used here to denote customer segmentation.
L’Oréal is looking to push heavily into ecommerce and build more direct consumer relationships, but admits it could sell off The Body Shop as sales struggle.
While many companies try to innovate, they are often doomed to fail. But according to senior marketers at Unilever, Britvic and L’Oréal there are various steps brands can take to ensure their product makes it through the critical first two years – from taking a closer look at customer behaviour to having a wider purpose.
Cosmetics group L’Oréal, named in the top 100 companies for ‘brand purpose’ in a new report by consultancy Radley Yeldar, claims that supporting women in science careers helps benefit shareholders while also benefiting society.
Mondelēz says it is looking for a successor for Dana Anderson but admits the nature of the CMO role could change as it looks for a “digital-first, disruptive and innovative leader”.

Mobile World Congress: Telefónica is putting a ‘brain’ in its network as it launches AI assistant Aura, but says the company will need to transform and digitise every part of the company to take advantage of the opportunity.
Telefónica is undergoing a digital transformation that will put artifical intelligence (AI) at the heart of its business.
Speaking at the opening keynote at Mobile World Congress today (27 February), Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete, CEO at Telefónica, explained how Telefónica is putting a “brain” in its network with the launch of AI assistant Aura. However, he warns that the company will need to transform and digitise every part of its business if it wants to take advantage of the opportunity.
He said: “We are not born digital, therefore digitising a company like [ours] is much more difficult that just being more digital.”
The company started the process of digital transformation several years ago to make its physical assets, IT systems and products and services intelligent. Alvarez-Pallete told the audience the process has enabled Aura to be created, calling it a “fourth platform” or the “brain in our network”.
Aura will enable users to manage their digital lives with the company and control the data generated by using Telefónica’s products and services securely. It’s a differentiator, according to the company,which claims it is the first in the industry to provide customers with the possibility of managing their relationship with the company based on cognitive intelligence.
Alvarez-Pallete said: “The network doesn’t sleep, our customers are on the network 24/7 and that means we need to put together all the information that we have in one place and make it clear that it’s their place, their brain, their network.
We are not born digital. Digitising a company like [ours] is much more difficult that just being more digital.
“The brain will be able to talk, listen, watch, remember [and] think. All of those powers will be in the hands of the customer. We want the customer to talk to Aura, ask Aura, [for it to] recommend what they need.”
He went on to claim that Aura is “more than” an assistant because of the control that customer will have over the platform. He described Aura as an open eco-system where the customer decides “the size and importance of their digital life” and what they want to do with their information. He said: “If they want to share it with third parties that is their decision.”
Alvarez-Pallete told the audience that the steps the company has taken to get to Aura was “not an easy task” and said the digital transformation process is “not there yet”. It required the company to simplify networks, tweak thousands of tariffs, radically digitalise processes and systems and switch off legacy systems.
“The whole organisation needs to be convinced that this is the way to go,” he said. “We all tend to look at ourselves by departments, [such as] tech, IT, HR, and that’s fine but if we are going to take advantage, we need to change our approach.”
AI is “uncharted territory” for Telefónica but the telecom giant also recognised the need for customers to feel empowered by its efforts to create a digital organisation and launch digital products.
He said: “It requires values, we need principles and to make sure [customers] feel secure, they feel we are transparent, have full access to the information in the network and feel the empowerment that it can provide.”
L’Oréal Paris is featuring a man in a mass market cosmetics ad for the first time, as it looks to broaden its appeal and become part of consumers’ daily lives.
P&G’s chief brand officer Marc Pritchard has called for the industry to join the company’s efforts to “clean up the media supply chain” and improve areas such as viewability, ad fraud and measurement.
The startup wants to “take the anxiety” out of weekday lunches with a cheaper option for office workers.

Paul Davies talks about what it takes to be a visionary and his expectations for the industry in the next ten years.
We spoke to Paul Davies, UK CMO at Microsoft and one of our Vision 100 on what it takes to be a visionary.
Davies said it takes a lot of curiosity and that visionaries need to be curious about the world around them and what makes people tick. He said that they should also have courage and the bravery to try different things.
He said he admires the astronaut Tim Peake for “inspiring a young generation and telling them they really can do anything with their lives.”
When asked what he feels the biggest change will be for the industry in the next ten years, he said it would be artificial intelligence, with “data being pulled together in different ways to create new experiences for consumers in ways that will be invisible.”
Watch the video to find out more on what qualities Davies thinks visionaries require and why he looks to music, the arts or theatre for inspiration.

We spoke to Kevin Sinfield, head of brand marketing at Taylor’s of Harrogate and one of our Vision 100 on what it takes to be a visionary. Sinfield said that visionaries need to be open to change, constantly open to new ideas and shouldn’t settle on the status quo. He said he admires David Brailsford […]

Robot hotel staff and virtual bank assistants have moved from science fiction to marketing fact, but systems that analyse customers’ data to give personalised responses must be used carefully to avoid appearing intrusive.
Artificial intelligence has been around since 1956 and has made some giant leaps in that time: beating the best human at chess, the best human at US gameshow Jeopardy and recently beating the best human at complex strategy game Go.
Brands have only recently started adopting artificial intelligence for core consumer services. Google’s voice recognition technology now claims 98% accuracy and Facebook’s DeepFace is said to recognise faces with a 97% success rate.
IBM’s Watson, which uses artificial intelligence to perform its question-answering function, is 2,400% “smarter” today than when it achieved the Jeopardy victory five years ago.
There is no doubt that the relationship between men and machines is changing, and brands are on the cusp of making artificial intelligence an everyday element of their customer offerings.
For example, with a goal of reducing the amount of calls coming through to its call centres, Swedish retail bank Swedbank has integrated the technology tool Nina into its customer service strategy. Nina, an intelligent virtual assistant, delivers automated customer service via the brand’s website in a conversational manner. This enables self-service capabilities and quick and easy access to information for Swedbank customers.
“If you as a customer came onto the site and said to Nina that you needed a new card, she would acknowledge the request but also drill down to find out why, asking: ‘Have you lost your old card or has it been damaged?’” says Martin Kedback, head of channel management at Swedbank. “According to what the customer then says, Nina will come back with a different answer or maybe direct the customer to a different channel.”
Swedbank’s artificial intelligence platform has been operating for more than a year and now deals with up to 80% of its 30,000 monthly enquiries. The brand, which operates globally, has worked with Nuance Communications to develop Nina’s natural language understanding (NLU) technology.
There is no attempt to trick customers into the idea that they are talking to a human, though. The bank has intentionally designed the tool without an avatar or anything that tries to look like a person.
“At the beginning, we threw in what we thought would be the hundred most commonly asked questions and answers in the database and then let the customers do the work,” Kedback says. “As they continued to ask questions, we made Nina smarter.”
Machines will be responding to requests at hotel reception desks and in all sorts of environments
In the future, Swedbank plans to personalise every interaction and make them, arguably, more rewarding for customers by integrating Nina into the customer database.
When a brand integrates AI into the fabric of its core data the information it is able to access will be much richer. But such a development then poses questions about what a brand does with that data, whether it is appropriate ethically and how marketers retain trust.
“While there is huge potential for brands to capitalise on AI to create more personalised experiences, they also need to be careful not to cross the ‘creepy’ line when it comes to customer privacy,” says Rachel Barton, managing director of advanced customer strategy at Accenture Strategy. “If you integrate the technology into customer data for instance, it has the potential to run loose and make its own judgements, which could be to the detriment of customers who may feel a level of intrusion they didn’t necessarily sign up to.”
If businesses can strike the right balance between adhering to their brand values while allowing AI to access the right amount of data, it can be highly beneficial – it is very cost effective and can deliver real-time personalisation that may not be possible via a human. However, Accenture research finds that when customers want to complain or talk through a complex situation they want to talk to a human.
Hospitality is one of the sectors thinking more boldly about the opportunities of AI. Luxury hotel portfolio Dorchester Collection is using it to identify what guests want, not what marketers think they want. To enhance its customer experience, it is using the AI Metis platform, which allows it to eschew the standardised hospitality industry measurement techniques such as mystery shoppers and customer satisfaction surveys and, instead, tap directly into digital customer feedback.
“Metis reads thousands of customer reviews and tells us what really matters to our customers,” says Ana Brant, The Dorchester Collection’s director for global guest experience and innovation. “Think of Metis as a giant focus group that not only facilitates the sessions in multiple languages but also summarises key findings, puts the findings in [context] with competitors and tells us stories worth listening to.”
The brand recently completed a comprehensive, brand-wide Metis study, which contained 7,454 guests reviews from 28 different hotels and 10 major hotel brands across 18 cities and regions. “New information is available to us every second – the biggest challenge is the constant pursuit of meaningful analysis,” Brant says. “She [Metis] summarised all the findings in a 30 minute interactive video and provided us with invaluable insight, further redefining our competitive advantage.”
Also in the hospitality industry, hotel brand Hilton has made AI a key part of the customer experience in the Hilton McLean in Virginia, USA. In partnership with IBM, Hilton is using Connie, the hospitality industry’s first Watson-enabled robot concierge, to cater to guests’ needs for information about a hotel and the surrounding area.
Connie gives consumers quick access to personalised information through cognitive reasoning and robotics. Hilton argues that Connie enhances the customer experience. Examples of interactions guests have with the robot include business travellers asking Connie for directions to their conference room or a family asking when the pool closes.
“We’re continuing to test and perfect Connie based on guest and hotel operator feedback, which enables us to explore new ways smart technology can enhance our guests’ travels,” says Jonathan Wilson, vice-president of product innovation and brand services at Hilton. “We’re at the forefront of using cognitive reasoning in hospitality – this is just the beginning of what’s possible. Future meetings at Hilton properties can be smarter and more productive because of Connie’s ability to quickly sort through massive amounts of online data to field on-the-spot research and data requests.”
AI is being used across sectors to improve efficiency, reduce costs, increase revenues and boost customer satisfaction by improving on key areas of customer experience. According to Calum Chace, author of Surviving AI, this is a very interesting time for AI. “In the past few years, machines have got better than us at recognising images, particularly faces, and recognising speech,” he says. “Those abilities mean we won’t have people in call centres for long – machines will also be widely responding to requests at hotel reception desks and personal enquiries in all sorts of on and offline environments.”
The introduction of robots and artificial intelligence (AI) in other guises is firmly under way in the hotel sector. UK brand Edwardian Hotels has launched a ‘virtual host’ service called Edward. For guests who enjoy interaction via text message, Edward will check you in before you even get to the hotel, get you spare towels or reserve you dinner.
Meanwhile, the Henn-na Hotel in Nagasaki, Japan, has a front desk staffed by robots and image recognition in place of keys.
In 2014, Starwood hotels ‘hired’ Botlr, a robotic butler, to help free up front desk staff’s time at the Aloft in Cupertino, Silicon Valley. It was Starwood’s first experiment with a robot and is a marker of the hotel brand’s enthusiasm for technology and an AI future.
“We are experimenting with AI and testing ways for guests to ‘speak’ to their rooms to control things such as lighting, temperature, making reservations and more,” says Brian McGuinness, global brand leader for Aloft Hotels. “Guests want control and we believe that by eventually weaving AI into the hotel experience, we can make a room smarter, giving guests more control over their stay.”
The brand plans to differentiate itself by the high personalisation levels it will offer. It is exploring ways for rooms to “pay attention” to guests’ personal preferences, so their favoured entertainment channels and environmental conditions will be available instantaneously.
Starwood acknowledges that technology is only as good as the people who work alongside it – especially in hospitality. “We think the future will see the rise of truly ‘smart’ rooms that respond to guests’ wants and needs just like a human would,” says McGuinness. “But we believe the human touch is a critical part of the hospitality business and don’t think robots or AI can or should ever replace the human touch.”
UNDER ARMOUR
Health and fitness routines are informed by personal, physiological and behavioural factors. Sports apparel brand Under Armour’s UA Record fitness app integrates machine learning technology to get under the skin of users. The app analyses personal food, exercise and sleep data in combination with insights from other anonymised members of the community, providing timely advice and motivation.
EASYJET
Budget airline easyJet is using artificial intelligence to analyse mind-boggling amounts of data. The airline plans to use AI to provide a service to match consumer demand. It is already a part of easyJet’s revenue management strategy and the airline will apply it in areas such as predicting catering needs and optimising destinations and flight times.
KNORR
Food brand Knorr has used cognitive technology, a component of AI, in its recent Love at First Taste campaign. A ‘Flavour Profiler’ is integrated into the brand’s site and offers tailored recipes. Behind this is a cognitive engine that can interact with humans ‘naturally’ and from which consumers can learn what recipes best suit them, based on their individual flavour profile.
SKYPE
When it was launched in 2003, Skype’s internet voice call software seemed like something out of sci-fi. Now it plugs into machine learning to deliver voice recognition and real-time translation. Users of the Skype Translate service speak into Skype, have the words translated into text and that text then synthesised into spoken Spanish, English, German, French, Italian or Mandarin.
WAYBLAZER
WayBlazer is a travel app that uses IBM’s Watson AI technology to give personalised recommendations. The B2B company works with businesses that merchandise hotels, tours, cruises and activities. Using Watson’s natural language abilities, it provides a way to personalise recommendations for travel, including local insights and points of interest for consumers.
When we think of artificial intelligence, most people think of two specific things: androids, and the future. We think of creations that will look, more or less, like humans, and things which are far off from our modern times.

The world’s first artificially intelligent poster campaign, which evolves to write its own copy and selects its own images and fonts based on the reactions of passersby, has gone live in London.
The ad, created by M&C Saatchi in partnership with Postercope and Clear Channel UK, has a camera that registers peoples’ engagement based on whether they look happy, sad or neutral. It then uses an algorithm that tests various executions based on the responses, “killing off” ads which don’t results in engagement and reproducing those that do. (See video)
It will run at a bus shelter outside Selfridges on Oxford Street this week, appearing to be a poster for an instant coffee brand, made up by the agency.
A second wave will run at Clapham Common from 10 to 21 August in order to account for the effect different environments, settings and timings could have on the engagement of passersby.
David Cox, chief innovation officer at M&C Saatchi, said the team wanted the ad to look like a real product to showcase how the technology could work for any brand.
If successful, the technology could provide an opportunity for brands to gather data on how consumers are reacting to their ads in real-time and optimise this across wider campaigns.
Cox added that the ad gets more successful and effective over time, resulting in a more personalised message that “doesn’t feel like you’re being advertised to”.
Glen Wilson, managing director of Posterscope, added: “Digital out-of-home campaigns can already tweak creative as they go, using real-time technologies that adapt based on factors like temperature, weather, travel info, location and time of day.
“However, this experiment goes one step further, evolving beyond a pure reliance on environmental factors to add emotional engagement as a measurable trigger, to ensure campaigns achieve maximum relevance.”
Despite this, Cox said that the main goal of the initiative is simply to “see how much tech we can cram into digital out of home”.
“Advertising is really bland a lot of the time and we want to be seen as experimenting,” he added. “In the industry we don’t experiment enough.”
He added that artificial creativity is becoming more prominent, and is something brands should be looking into.
“When you buy things, things are being suggested to you by algorithms, not by people,” he added, citing Amazon’s online recommendations as a prime example.
He added that a next step of the ad could be making it interactive.
“We keep coming up with ideas on how to extend it,” he said. “We are not suggesting a diminished role for creative but we know technology will be playing a greater part in what we do.”
Neil Chapman, head of create at Clear Channel, agreed.
“We know that this is merely scratching the surface of the potential for artificial intelligence in the digital out of home arena and are very much looking forward to exploring the possibilities this kind of technology presents for advertisers in the near future,” he added.
The future of personalisation could involve a digital personal shopping assistant to “help users through the fragmented customer journey” according to Google’s vp of product management Jonathan Alferness.
If Stephen Hawking is right, and machines start to think for themselves and use intuition to second-guess the vagaries of human beings, we have an intriguing future ahead.
Less than half (49%) of online ads served in the UK met the IAB and Media Rating Council’s recommendations – that an ad is only considered viewable if it is 50% is in view for at least one second – in the second quarter of 2015, according to a new report from Meetrics, suggesting brands could have wasted £485m on ads that weren’t seen.

I see that Theglobe.com, one of those Internet companies with the clumsy names, has made a less than clumsy debut on the Nasdaq market in the US, showing a sevenfold increase in value in early share dealings.
This event has been leapt upon by bullish commentators as a demonstration that there is not only life but vigour in the market for flotations, or initial public offerings (IPOs) as the Americans call them.
I have no reason to believe that Theglobe.com is worth anything other than every cent of its after-market premium. Indeed, I wrote only recently that Internet stocks were going to be the investments which create the millionaires and billionaires of the new millennium.
That said, a note of caution is called for. When I wrote enthusiastically about Internet shares, we were in the ructions of a new bear market.
The sector’s stocks largely bucked the downward trend. Listed online services, such as book retailer Amazon, suffered initial valuation setbacks, only to recover as sentiment began once again to support well-run Internet companies. That was an October story.
More recent events in the US IPO market would seem to bear out this theory. But, by the same token, let’s not get carried away.
There are still concerns emerging about the hype surrounding some Internet company valuations. Some of this concern is directed at the unblinking support that commentators have offered from a position of relative ignorance. Having provided some of that support, I feel obliged not to join the ranks of the entirely ignorant.
I was involved with the launch of Electronic Share Information (ESI) in London in 1995, a service launched to provide real-time share information and dealing over the Internet. Some 200 commentators must have attended the launch and/or been briefed, from which about 14 elected to accept an invitation to link to the Internet for a service demonstration.
I wonder whether that implies that more than 180 pundits were already Net-literate. I doubt it. Nor do I seek to suggest that they were indolent in their examination. The fact is there is so much commentary from lawyers and spindoctors regarding the Web that you don’t have to be a Net expert. The result is that everyone is regularly commentating on the commentary.
Does this matter? Yes, I think it does, because on occasions – possibly in the US IPO market – it can mean that the online industry is entirely valued as the result of spin, with fundamentals playing little or no part.
There is a saying in California’s Silicon Valley that all you need to launch a successful IPO in the Internet sector is to get “three dogs barking”. This might mean one dog barking in the valley, followed by one media dog, which in turn sets off a dog on Wall Street.
I think it might be simpler than that. It’s an image of a shanty town, where strangers are greeted enthusiastically by street dogs which wake up the neighbourhood.
How, we might ask, did Internet service provider Yahoo! come to be worth some $20bn (12bn)? The simple answer must be that the market is willing to capitalise it at that level. That makes a valuation irrefutable.
But I would ask you to consider a view from the other end of the equation. On Wall Street, it is asked how you might turn a $1 bill into a $10 bill. The answer, it is said, is by writing the word “Internet” on it.
Again, does that matter? Isn’t that how markets work, backing sentiment and the principle that a share is worth what someone else will pay for it? Well, up to a point.
I would cite three concerns. Firstly, there is the bio-technology precedent. Bio-tech companies came unstuck over the past year, not despite the hype of their prospects, but because of it.
Secondly, there is a danger that artificial markets could be emerging, particularly in the US, where there is a political need to maintain optimism in retail investment markets.
Thirdly, the Internet speaks with no authority in its own right. Since there is no proprietor, massed individuals and vested interests compete with one another to talk up the market.
Any one of those factors could lead to a dangerous over-inflation, both of expectations and valuations.
An old colleague of mine used to warn that, if you suspected a dangerous new orthodoxy was emerging, you should look for Druids. By this, he meant that there were certain to be those around telling you the sun would surely rise, because it had always done so before.
A dangerous attitude in stock markets. There may be an orthodoxy emerging which would have us believe that Internet companies are highly valued because they’re so important. The trouble is that, equally, they are important because they are highly valued.
I don’t suggest they are anything other than exciting opportunities for investors. I just add a note of caution. Listen for dogs barking. And watch out for Druids.

BMW is launching a Siri-like artificial intelligence SMS information service to help promote and educate consumers about its first ever fully-electric car.
The “i Genius” service will be promoted across BMW’s advertising for the BMW i3, which is due to go on sale in the UK in late 2013.
I Genius uses software that is capable of interpreting words, their context and sentiment to instantly respond to questions.
Consumers can text their questions for free and the system will instantly respond. If people ask a non-sensical or rude question, I Genius will answer with stock replies such as “I could talk about that, but I’d much rather talk about the new BMW i3”.
It is hoped i Genius, which was created by start-up London Brand Management, will help consumers make better buying decisions when it comes to choosing an electric car because they can ask questions at any time and at any location – rather than having to wait to call a customer service line or visit a dealership.
BMW group UK marketing director Chris Brownridge says the platform will help “exceed expectations” of consumers who are becoming “increasingly sophisticated” in how they choose to interact with the company. If successful, BMW will consider rolling out the service on marketing material around its other vehicles.
The partnership between BMW and London Brand Management is the first to come from the recently launched marketing technology accelerator scheme The Bakery.
The Bakery is supported by the IPA, Tech City Investment Organisation and UK Trade & Investment and agencies including Vizeum, Havas Worldwide, MBA, Karmarama and KittCattNohr Digitas. Other brands on the scheme include Ab-Inbev, Heinz, Panasonic and Ideal Standard. 
Team Sky is looking to monetise the high profile it has enjoyed since the success of riders Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome by using a tool that allows sponsors to see in real-time how their branded content is being shared. 
Twinings, Yorkshire Tea, PG Tips and Tetley are looking to tap into the emergence of tea as a popular choice among younger drinkers by launching marketing strategies capable of exploiting the broader repertoire of tea blends now in demand.
Virgin Media has added to its staple of gold medal winning brand ambassadors by signing a sponsorship deal with two time world champion 400m runner Christine Ohuruogu.

P&G’s decision to cut digital ad spend last quarter shows too many brands are still wasting money on ineffective digital ads.
Procter & Gamble (P&G) last week became one of the first advertisers to admit to a significant reduction in digital ad spend in the wake of the brand safety scandal.
On a results call, the FMCG giant’s CFO Jon Moeller said it had cut between $100m and $140m from its digital ad budget last quarter because of brand safety concerns and “ineffective” ads. In a statement, P&G said the move was temporary as the brand looked to ensure its ads were not being placed in digital forums that did not meet its standards and specifications.
However, Moeller suggested the company was in no rush to put money back into digital media. “Clearly we don’t need to be spending money that is seen by a bot and not a person. Clearly we don’t need to be spending money on ads that are placed in inappropriate places, and that’s why you see a significant reduction.”
That he has taken this view is not surprising given that P&G is saying it saw little downside to this pullback. Moeller highlighted that P&G still delivered over 2% organic sales growth on 2% volume growth, suggesting that what was cut “was largely ineffective”.
He explained: “Importantly, as we made those decisions and put our money where our mouth has been in terms of the need to increase the efficiency of that supply chain, ensure solid and strong placement of individual ads, we didn’t see a reduction in the growth rate.
“What we’d love to do, and what we’re working with our media partners to do, is create a very efficient supply chain that helps us build our brands. And we’d love to invest more in doing just that.”
Moeller did not explicitly point the finger at any particular digital platform, but YouTube in particular has been hit by a scandal over ads appearing next to unsavoury content. P&G’s chief brand officer has also been very vocal about what he calls the “murky” media supply system.
While it is widely known that many brands pulled advertising from YouTube and in some cases Google’s display network, for many that was just a short-term move. The vast majority of brands have said they are now back advertising having been happy with what they have seen from the company in terms of sorting the issue.
However, new data suggests that brands are being more careful about what digital content they advertise alongside. A study by advertising intelligence company MediaRadar Unilever suggests the packaged goods company has reduced its budgets as well as the number of sites it buys on.
Audience buying at scale across the web indiscriminately is madness.
The report shows Unilever advertised on 606 sites between January and May 2016, but this fell to 540 sites for the same period in 2017, representing an 11% drop. Spend was down 59% year on year.
P&G’s move and the MediaRadar stats suggest brands are now taking steps to protect their brands online.
“It’s quite clear that [brands are] worried about the impact on their brands when placed alongside objectionable content. And some of the ad placements just don’t work. This marries with what we’ve been banging on about all year, which is that audience buying at scale across the web indiscriminately is madness,” says Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer at the Guardian News and Media.
The Guardian was one of the brands affected by YouTube’s brand safety scandal, with its brands placed next to extremist content. The publisher consequently pulled all of its advertising from the platform and still has not returned. YouTube has since been on a major drive to reassure advertisers by investing heavily in brand safety measures such as artificial intelligence.
There are many in the industry who believe that over-investment in digital is “very common” among advertisers. Last year, WPP’s CEO Sir Martin Sorrell said he expected growth in digital ad spend to slow over the next few years due to concerns over viewability, ad fraud and measurement.
“What has really been happening is questioning digital growth. One of our major clients has talked about investment in Facebook and reducing that, not overall but investment on particular areas of activity,” he explained at the time.
However, this doesn’t appear to be happening yet. The IPA’s latest quarterly Bellwether survey showed that digital ad budgets saw their biggest rise in nearly a decade in the second quarter, while the Ad Association and Warc’s quarterly report showed digital growth continuing.
And it certainly isn’t impact the digital duopoly. Facebook’s results for the three months ending June 30 show its advertising revenues up 47% year on year at $9.2bn despite it admitting to 10 measurement errors.
Meanwhile, YouTube’s brand safety controversy has had little impact on Google’s ad business. Alphabet, Google’s holding company, saw revenues increase 22% year on year to $24.8bn (£19.2bn) in its most recent results and the scandal wasn’t even mentioned on its results call.
“At the end of the day, these companies own an awful lot of different platforms and so I don’t think it will hit them. Those who will be impacted are probably long tail websites that were set up purely to create money out of advertising and don’t add value – and so this isn’t necessarily a bad thing,” Nicklin adds.
Marketers are likely to keep putting money into digital and particularly into Facebook and Google. But that does not mean they shouldn’t re-evaluate how and where they put their money to weed out ineffective spend, as P&G has done.
Marketers should also beware of using digital too much for sales and not enough for brand building. This is an area that even P&G admits it has not got right, and that it needs to focus more building its brands online.
“A lot of people have been seduced by a dream that the big networks such as Facebook, Google and Instagram have promised, which is ‘we can target the shit out of your ads, and make sure your money is reaching people at the right time with the right message’. But direct mail has never been used to build brands, and neither does programmatic buying. Marketers need to finally start taking a different approach to digital marketing,” says Dan Deeks-Osburn creative agency Impero’s strategy director.
Of course they will. The  growing perception of “I don’t know what I’m getting for my money”coupled with “fraud” and “transparency” gives them no choice to retract and spend elsewhere.
Fortunately GDPR is going to impose clarity.
YouTube says it recognises it needs to improve brand safety, and is using machine learning to help it crack down on unsavoury content.
While some brands such as McDonald’s and RBS have resumed spending on YouTube, the majority including M&S, Tesco and Pepsi have not as they wait for ‘guarantees’ from Google.
The social network seems to think that finding and admitting its errors will pacify marketers but they will not be happy until they get full, independent, third-party verification.
Almost 500 complaints were filed against the ad, which shows chickens confidently strutting around a barn to DMX’s ‘X Gon’ Give It To Ya’.

This week’s round-up includes Amazon promising ‘thousands of jobs’ in Australia, India cracking down on marketing by pharmaceutical companies and Tesco repositioning its brand in Ireland.
Pizza Hut is launching what it claims is the only national pizza loyalty programme in the US. The scheme will reward customers points for every dollar spent online, meaning customers can potentially earn free pizza after just one visit.
Called Hut Rewards, customers get two points for every $1 spent, which can be applied towards a medium pizza from just 200 points or a large from just 250. There is no limit to how many points customers can earn.
“The new Hut Rewards program enables customers to earn unlimited points as well as a free pizza in as little as one order, which is why we believe it is the best loyalty program in the category,” says Jeff Fox, chief brand and concept officer at Pizza Hut US. “By exclusively rewarding customers with points for every dollar spent on food online, we like to say that it pays to be loyal at Pizza Hut.”
Members also get access to a range of other benefits including exclusive offers and birthday rewards. The move follows a deeper focus on digital at Pizza Hut, including a tracker that allows people to track their delivery, an Amazon Alexa voice service and a Facebook and Twitter chatbot menu.
Tesco has launched a new marketing campaign as part of a three-year plan to reposition its brand in Ireland. The TV ad, created by ad agency Rothco, focuses on Irish family life and is based on the insight that when customers shop they do so with their families in mind, not as individuals.
It follows the success of its Christmas campaign ‘Here’s to the hosts, family makes us better’, which aimed to put authentic family life at the heart of the brand.
“Above all else, family is hugely important to Irish people, and what we’ve discovered is that what Irish families may not realise, however, is how important family is to Tesco too,” says Sean Nolan, head of customer marketing at Tesco Ireland.
“We’re committed to putting family at the heart of everything we do. This isn’t a new departure for us, we have always been rooted in families; we are made up of Irish families, from our colleagues to our suppliers to every generation of our farming families. We firmly believe that this direction will help us to add warmth, understanding and underpin our role in helping Irish families”.
Tesco will spend €3.2m (£2.9m) on the campaign across TV, outdoor, social and digital channels. This includes spend on advertising on its own assets including shopping bags, delivery vans and in store.
Amazon will bring “thousands of new jobs” to Australia and “millions of dollars of investment” over time, according to its new director of operations Robert Bruce.
Bruce, whose former roles include being the president of Vistaprint for Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, and global director at automotive safety systems manufacture Autoliv, is the man charged with Amazon’s regional operations.
Amazon confirmed it will straight away create hundreds of new jobs with the opening of its first Australian ‘fulfilment centre’ in Dandenong South. It has already started recruiting for a range of roles, including operations managers, pickers, packers, systems technicians, and HR specialists.
While these are centre-based jobs, it was also reported earlier this week that Amazon is also hunting 230 office staff Down Under, as it eyes the music streaming market, artificial intelligence and other areas.

India, one of the world’s largest markets for pharmaceuticals, is drawing up its first set of marketing rules for drugmakers. This will see it restrict gifts and trips offered to doctors and pharmacists to 1,000 rupees (£12), according to a draft proposal seen by Reuters.
While such rules are common elsewhere in the world and adhered to by large pharmaceutical companies, they are not set in stone in India, where campaigners have long demanded a crackdown on unethical selling practices.
These have included gifts ranging from electrical appliances to foreign junkets to encourage doctors and pharmacists to prescribe and stock certain medications.
Currently, India has only a voluntary marketing code that critics say is ineffective. Besides limiting marketing spend, the draft proposal also forbids drugmakers from making false claims on the curative abilities and results of drugs.

Businesses in South East Asia (SEA) have shown a 40% year-on-year increase in smartphone conversion rates, according to new research by Adobe.
The report suggests this is predominantly due to improvement in connectivity and data speeds. The findings of the research are based on aggregated and anonymous data from 100 billion visits to 3,000 websites across the region.
The SEA region experienced an 18% year-on-year increase for smartphone traffic to 37%, falling just below the Asia-Pacific (APAC) average of 39%. There was also a 40% year-on-year increase in smartphone conversion rates to 0.7% – but the region still lags behind the APAC average rate of 1.1%.
“SEA’s smartphone conversions have grown incredibly over the past year, but are still falling behind all other countries measured, with significant room for improvements. Brands need to adapt quickly to this change in the way consumers are engaging on the web, to make gains for the decreased time spent and stickiness seen across almost every industry,” says Tamara Gaffney, head of Adobe Digital Insights.

Tesco is looking to increase the level of personalisation in its mobile marketing in a bid to make the channel more effective and improve the experience for customers.
The ecommerce giant is hoping to make major inroads into fashion retail with the launch of a new tailored delivery service.
Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and CEO, says the move makes good business sense because “millions of people love Whole Foods Market”.
The telecoms giant is changing its advertising style to take a more emotional approach in a bid to become more “relevant” to consumers’ lives.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.
The laundry app’s chief Ed Relf on building brands by focusing on trust and why marketers make the best entrepreneurs.

The Google memo by engineer James Damore, attacking the company for pursuing gender diversity, shows how damaging it is to make sex-based assumptions – but it also reveals big political problems for the web giant.

Whether it’s targeting, viewability or video, marketing debate is beset by equal and opposing viewpoints of such vehemence that it makes it look like we don’t know what we’re doing.
The worst of all sins in marketing, in my book at least, is the use of that hoary old quote often incorrectly attributed to either John Wanamaker or Lord Leverhulme. You know the one with the apocryphal line that “half the money I spend on advertising is wasted, the trouble is I don’t know which half”. If it crops up in a presentation, marketing article or debate – with the exception of this masterpiece you’re reading at the moment – it signals an almost inevitable journey to cliché and obviousness in equal measure.
But there is another problem with that quote these days: it’s not just a cliché, it’s also wholly inconsistent with the current way in which we discuss anything in marketing. Gone is the uncertainty and open, plaintive thinking of an earlier age in marketing when we queried with honest introspection what does and does not seem to be working. That’s been replaced by a form of tribal combat in which different sides hammer each other with exactly the opposite point of view constructed from equal parts of wobbly data and fake news.
READ MORE: Marketing must be better defined to be taken seriously
Rather than Lord Leverhulme bemoaning his uncertain advertising spend, today’s equivalent axiom would have him boasting “I’m spending all my money on digital and it’s working 180%”, followed by his arch nemesis Lord Beaverbrook retorting “shut your face Leverhulme, your money is being wasted because you don’t understand content marketing like what I do”.
Everywhere you look in marketing there isn’t just debate about what is and isn’t the right approach, there is vehement and unyielding certainty that my way is correct and yours is total balls.
Take the debate about brand safety for example. Depending on who you listen to it is either a massive threat to brand equity that has infected a significant proportion of global advertising, or it’s a tiny issue that was drummed up by the traditional media to inflict maximum damage on Google and other digital platforms and has been largely forgotten. Clearly it can’t be both, so which Is it?
If we ran a poll here on Marketing Week’s home page and asked readers to rate the degree to which brand safety is a serious threat to your brand on a scale of 1 (no threat) to 10 (huge threat) I am betting that we’d derive an average of around 5 but that the answers would be polarised at either end of the spectrum.
And it’s that polarisation that afflicts and affects seemingly every dimension of marketing. It makes for fabulous arguments on social media, juicy debates at conferences and several emotional comments at the foot of Marketing Week columns. But it also complicates the act of doing marketing tremendously.
Marketing debate is tribal combat in which different sides hammer each other with views constructed from equal parts of wobbly data and fake news.
It has never been a more exhilarating or exhausting time to work in this discipline. Never before has so much happened in marketing with so little consensus around what is and isn’t working. We do our business on what appears to be a continually moving and undulating platform of knowledge that constantly contradicts and reverses itself as we cling on for grim life.
Look at the act of targeting. I can spend a morning with a client that is convinced of the merits of micro-targeting using digitally enabled options such as lookalike modelling and A/B testing, and then the afternoon with a second company that follows the sophisticated mass-marketing approach and now believes (incorrectly) that it can go after everyone with a pulse. Depending on how you look at it you either target no one and let the computer do it for you, or everyone.
Take the optimum length of digital video advertising on Facebook. I can cite extremely persuasive men and women who tell me not to worry about sub-two-second exposures because that is more than sufficient to influence consumer decision making, and who then remind me that digital video is more complex than simply putting overly long TV ads online. Just as I am nodding and starting to get my head around two-second exposure models someone else pops up and says: “Bollocks! We are getting incredible results from three minute films.”
READ MORE: Mark Ritson – Why can’t marketers see that digital metrics are bullshit?
Or how about viewability? It seems logical to assume that 100% viewability is the gold standard for digital media. If consumers can’t see the bloody ad then clearly it’s not going to be impactful. So surely 100% viewability is the way forward?
Well not necessarily. It turns out that chasing 100% viewability often leads to much more expensive programmatic prices, opens you up to far greater risk of ad fraud (you always get 100% viewability from a bot) and generally ensures that the overall impact of advertising is lessened. Depending on who you ask, 100% viewability is either the only acceptable way to ensure effectiveness or a guaranteed way to reduce it.
You see what I mean? As soon as we develop even the semblance of marketing best practice, someone turns up, turns it upside down and claims the opposite. You need marketing training; you don’t need marketing training. Artificial Intelligence is dangerous; artificial intelligence is essential. Marketing needs to get back to basics; marketing is changing dramatically. Content marketing is a crucial new development in marketing; content marketing is just a bunch of fancy names for stuff that has existed for 50 years.
I could go on – trust me – and on.
Surely you have seen it yourself. You read an article on a marketing concept and then, in the comments section, another marketer not only disagrees, they go out of their way to completely refute the whole nature of the original argument and supplant it with the exact opposite perspective.
My favourite current example is programmatic. There are only two clear and overriding observations we can make about programmatic in mid-2017. First, it’s growing like the clappers. Second, it’s unavoidable given the plethora of new channels that now exist and exceed human capabilities. More contentious is the current state of programmatic and whether the murky media supply chain and the multiple commissions it takes renders it inefficient.
I certainly think that’s the case and have been very – ahem – vocal on the subject. That has resulted in an entirely typical marketing response.
Two very senior, very smart media professionals have responded to my wailings in the same Australian marketing site independent of each other. One of them agrees wholeheartedly with me. The other disagrees completely and, very politely, suggests my argument is nonsensical.
I read both articles, and was persuaded mightily by both articles, even though they perfectly contradict each other. My point is not to dwell on the respective arguments of my two commentators but to suggest that this is the nature of marketing these days. Everything is up, unless you think it’s down.
Maybe the answer to all the quandaries is: it depends. That was usually the right answer in marketing in the olden days. We would look at the brand, the target segment and the objectives, and these factors would direct us to the make the right choice from the potential options in front of us.
But that’s not how contemporary marketing works. There is no room for ‘it depends’ anymore. It’s either totally wrong if you belong to tribe A or, if you belong to tribe B, entirely and completely correct.
We seem to have lost nuance, relativity and context. In our search for definitive answers to marketing’s big questions we’ve created chaos. It’s an exciting, fast-moving and emotional chaos. But it’s chaos nonetheless. And I wonder if things will ever calm down again.
But why bother asking you? Given you are also a marketer operating in 2017 I already know what your response will be. This column is nonsense and my point of view ridiculous. There is no issue with polarisation within marketing; we are all completely and utterly aligned.
Unless, that is, you disagree.
Peddlers of digital ads/content (f***** agency types) need to step out of the types of debate I know you’re referring to. I’ve seen them many times on LinkedIn, been present at “digital forums” where some paid-up numpty who sponsored the event wants to sound clever (like a walking cliché). 
The inevitable result is, for those unfortunate to have joined/looked in is: Guy with something to lose (like money, credibility, a business case – or all three) in “slating anything which questions how he ears his money” shocker.
More often than not, they seem very well-versed in the formulas that go into estimating TV audiences and the effectiveness of adverts, despite never working in TV or with TV content/advertising – but will in the same breath absolutely ignore things called facts, like rising TV viewing figures. And it all surprises nobody.
Because of these people, and other similarly clever-dicks, today is the shittiest time in history to be in marketing.
it sounds suspiciously similar to army ventriloquism to me; you’re not paid to have an opinion, soldier – just keep digging…
As ever a thought-provoking read. Marketing (as a discipline) does not exist as a one-size-fits-all solution. In the same way as you would approach a marketing challenge by segmenting your market, marketing itself can be segmented, and the right bits applied in the right way. There will however, never be a single “right” way.
Many damn fool marketing ideas work for a short while, because of the novelty effect. Long enough for marketers to report they succeeded and blog jubilantly on the Web. 
Then when they stop working, marketers either don’t notice or are too embarrassed to write corrections. The result is that so much marketing “science” is anything but.
Much of the debate on marketing appears to be that of undoubtedly talented intellectual Tarzans swinging around in the forest canopy with little regard for the roots that support it. Indeed it seems unlikely that they ever come down to earth.
A good base would be a clear definition of marketing, so that everyone knew what they are talking about. At the moment there are none, the offerings that purport to be such go no further than descriptions.
Maybe this might help, at least to get some discussion started on the subject.

I know you need to come up with stuff to write Mark, but there’s no need to over complicate this or lose hope. Of course the answer is: it depends.  Always was, always will be.  Objectives, segmentation,  targeting, positioning, the comms mix and budget. Everything is contingent upon that and the permutations are endless which is why we like doing it.
I have to agree with Al King. The answer must always be, “it depends.”
It depends on your budget, your business goals, your marketing strategy, your target market . . . on so many factors. Good marketers are those that can understand all these factors and pull together the tools/tactics/channels to achieve their goals. Good marketers use the tools that will get the job done, whether they are brand new or have been around for a hundred years.
However lately it seems as though you must either be a disciple of the cult of digital, where every marketing problem can be solved through the proper application of a “digital marketing strategy,” or you must be a marketing dinosaur, a marketing curmudgeon yelling at the digital kids to ‘get off your lawn!’
Agree with your hypothesis.  However, isn’t the cause that comment sections like this have turned us all into (fake) experts?  Blogs, LinkedIn posts, tweets etc have further exacerbated the fissures between each side of a debate (as they have done in the political world with disastrous consequences, ahem Trump, ahem!), because everyone is now free to voice an opinion.  As ever in any debate, the loudest, most obnoxious opinions are the ones we feel drawn to the most.  Hmm, in the case, maybe I need to change my opinion.  This column is total bollox and the author has no idea what he’s talking about.
The rise of angry binary thinkers is not just limited to Marketing. You can see examples everywhere from Universities no platforming speakers to radical groups of many shades. This could have bigger implications for all of us.
Slightly embarrassing to say this here but isn’t online journalism one of the issues?  A headline that doesn’t dramatise, over-simplify, involve ‘death of’ or promise a punch-up won’t get clicked on.
Great article.  Yes, Al King, it depends.  It always has; it always will. Marks says that “We seem to have lost nuance, relativity and context”, so not sure where your criticism is directed.  I believe the cause of this polarisation within the marketing world is exactly as Malcolm Wicks describes.  There’s a shift towards over-simplification everywhere.  Look at politics; whether in Europe or in USA.  The nuanced complexity of real life is just too dull / complicated / unpalatable for people to cope with, so we make ourselves feel better in echo chambers where we can comfort ourselves listening to the same polarised opinions, popping out occasionally to goad the enemy.  I find it all as depressing as Mark does.  If any business discipline should acknowledge the complexity and inherent ambiguity of customer decision-making, it’s marketing.
Digital metrics are a mess of confusion and obfuscation, but it’s clear most marketers have bought into this opaque and over-complicated world.
Some 90% of advertisers aren’t happy with their current programmatic relationship, while two-thirds are uncomfortable with the conflicts created by principal trading, according to a new WFA report.
Having worked at Tesco for over 10 years as a supply chain director, Bruno Monteyne is now one of the UK’s most respected retail analysts. He tells Marketing Week why marketing, which he describes as a “critical” business function, needs to become more clearly defined.
In an uncharted world of exponential change driven by technology, marketing leadership means depending on judgement as much as data, and personality as much as skills.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

Marketers must retain a healthy scepticism about AI – while it will transform search marketing and customer relations, everyone claims to have an offering whether they do or not.
 What do marketers really need to know about artificial intelligence (AI)? First let’s define it, as the name itself gives vital clues. It’s more than automation: ‘intelligence’ suggests that it can adapt and learn, and implies that it does this in a human-like way. But ‘artificial’ means it’s not human.
Oxforddictionaries.com defines AI as “the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages”. To which I would quickly add pattern recognition, and for marketers, also prediction and interpretation.
READ MORE: Mark Ritson – Machine learning may be the future but it’s still pretty dumb
Wherever AI is mentioned, the phrase ‘machine learning’ invariably accompanies. Intelligence learns. It’s everywhere already, albeit at a fairly nascent level. For example:
With AI comes the search to remove the interface (keyboard, mouse, keypad, remote control) and replace them with voice or gesture. Voice is seen as the most likely- it is universal and therefore low-hanging fruit. Thought is still some way off but is being explored in labs worldwide. Virtual assistants like Amazon Echo’s Alexa show what huge strides have been made recently in voice, once the source of much bemusement and ire.
They will change our lives. Voice-activated search is now common and growing fast, and presents opportunity and challenge for marketers now used to spending significantly on search and wanting to remain high in the rankings. Any decent search strategy must now include voice.
Just as in programmatic, pretty much everybody has realised that they need to be seen to have an offering whether or not they actually do.
As they show the way, there’s rising expectation that customer relationship management (CRM) systems like customer helplines will catch up.
CRM has arguably been one of the great misnomers of marketing, the ‘R’ too seldom being delivered. Whether poor personalisation (my all-time favourite was sending us girls’ nappies in the size our son had just grown out of) or archaic call handling.
How many times are we asked to input information only to be asked for it again when (finally) connected to an operator who (just might) be able and empowered to help?
Better retention of customer data once input is just better automation, but prediction of why they might be calling and better routing to qualified staff requires interpretative power. Enter AI.
AI is also being applied to many other business systems. It’s beginning to bleed into programmatic media buying (wherein individual online ad impressions are called, auctioned, filled and served in real time, using data), though in truth that’s as yet only advanced automation.
Even among the more sophisticated online retailers, real AI still pretty much in its infancy. Quite clunky retargeting has yet to give way to a more intuitive approach. Instead of trying to sell you another kettle, they could perhaps impute from other data that you might just have moved in and suggest other homemaking ideas? Or tea or coffee? Even a Nespresso machine.
READ MORE: There needs to be more clarity on who takes ownership of AI, says First Utility
Comma.ai founder George Hotz distinguishes between AI that ploughs through huge amounts of data to learn to ‘think’ as opposed to following strict programmed rules.
Truly useful AI systems must be developed by people with the imagination and insight to go beyond more of the same. Marketers, used to dealing with insight, can and should lead here.
And AI is indeed beginning to be applied to both insight and ROI. Major tech, consulting and ad holding groups are reputedly focussing in this area, combining computing power, smart maths and intuitive programming skills.
Danish media agency Blackwood Seven is a disruptor in the media value chain and is already making great strides in several markets for its growing roster of serious clients (disclosure: I’m a UK director).
The future will see intuitively targeted and served media buys with optimised ad content. Unfortunately, there’s also a lot of bullshit around. Just as in programmatic, pretty much everybody has realised that they need to be seen to have an offering whether or not they actually do. So most everybody is claiming AI. Marketers must therefore do due diligence and check candidate partners’ credentials carefully.
New media markets will open up. Driverless cars will allow many more people to read and watch video within the vehicle or personalise billboards outside – though on current form, it’s depressingly easy to envisage endless ads for the fast-food joint at the next junction.
As our homes become smarter they will suggest entertainment, recipes, places to go, and things to do and buy, based on their learning and interpretation of our preferences and desires. There are opportunities in each for marketers to enter the conversation. Respectfully, of course, lest they get blocked like so many of their ads.
On so many levels, AI doubtless offers a potentially rich, if still not that clear, future. So here are some practical steps to take:
The AI/Marketing scene has been rather eventful and exciting over the past year. Sure there’s a lot of hype and marketers should develop a sensible approach–I wrote about the very same thing in Advertising Age in the U.S. But to generalize AI as ‘snake oil’ might be overblowing it a bit. 
Persado, which helps brands better engage consumers by identifying and generating language that emotionally connects using AI, has been a proper company for nearly 5 years, and in development years before that–way before the marketing AI label was tossed about. What matters more is that the solution consistently delivers, and that we have complete transparency and accountability into our process…so much so that we invite all comers, and your readers, to come and kick our tyres.
If machine learning is so clever, why does Spotify recommend such rubbish songs and Amazon suggest the stuff I already own in different colours?
Vodafone is focusing on AI, voice and its chatbot TOBi as it concentrates on customer service and an internal digital transformation.
The gas and electricity provider says it can be difficult convincing a board to invest in AI-based technology such as chatbots.
The insight techniques used by the world’s biggest brands may seem unattainable, but their experimentation gives all companies something to learn from, says ESOMAR director general Finn Raben.

Catch up on all the latest marketing news with our morning round-up.
Sales at Yum! Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell, slipped below target in the quarter to 30 June, increasing by just 2%.
Poor performance at Pizza Hut was seen as the cause, which reported a 1% drop in same-store revenue, compared to growth of 3% at KFC and 4% at Taco Bell. As a result of the missed sales target, shares in Yum! Brands fell more than 2%.
The company also reported a 23% decline in net income to $206m, while total revenues fell 4% to $1.45bn.
Yum! Brands has invested $130m in upgrading equipment, advertising and revamping restaurant technology in a bid to strengthen its pizza business. However, during the second quarter this strategy left the organisation with a $12m charge due to investments in Pizza Hut’s digital platforms.

Milk brand Arla Cravendale has launched a £3m advertising campaign focused on freshness.
Playing on the theme of local myths and legends, the ‘Moonicow’ campaign will feature a 60-second mockumentary style advert set in the fictional village of Cravendale, where residents claim their fresh tasting milk comes from the mythical Moonicow.
Developed in collaboration with Wieden+Kennedy London and filmed by former Brass Eye director Michael Cumming, the advert will appear on television, video-on-demand and social media throughout August. The campaign will also link up with influencers including food bloggers and Fred Sirieix, the host of Channel 4’s First Dates.
Green & Black’s is launching its first UK product without a Fairtrade or organic label.
The new Velvet Edition dark chocolate bars, set to go on sale in the UK this month, will carry the Cocoa Life certification created by Green & Black’s owner, Mondelēz International.
Speaking to the BBC, Glenn Caton, Northern Europe president of Mondelēz , explained that the beans required to make the Velvet Edition were not available at scale as an organic product and therefore needed to be “sustainably sourced” through the independently verified Cocoa Life programme.
Described as a “holistic, cocoa sustainability programme in partnership with Fairtrade”, the Cocoa Life branding is rapidly replacing the Fairtrade logo across all Mondelēz -owned chocolate products. By 2019, Cadbury’s entire chocolate range in the UK and Ireland will display the Cocoa Life logo.
Going forward all Green & Black’s ranges, aside from the Velvet Edition, will continue to be organic and carry the Fairtrade logo.
Mondelēz joins a growing list of brands abandoning Fairtrade certification, including Sainsbury’s which is rolling out its Fairly Traded brand and Tesco, which is expected to switch all its own-label coffee to the Rainforest Alliance ethical certification scheme.

Fashion brand Uniqlo has installed a vending machine dispensing men and women’s shirts and lightweight jackets at Oakland Airport, California.
Nine other machines will be rolled out to airports and shopping centres in Los Angeles, Houston and New York over the coming months, chosen as high-traffic locations that supplement Uniqlo’s 45 stores across the country. Prices will start at $15 (£11.30) for a top, climbing to $70 (£53) for a lightweight jackets.
The vending machines are exclusive to the US, where the Japanese retailer hopes to gain ground with consumers after failing to make significant inroads into the American market.

Professional services firm Accenture has snapped up marketing and sales consultancy Brand Learning for an undisclosed sum.
The acquisition is intended to strengthen Accenture’s end-to-end marketing and sales capabilities, linking into the digital design and engagement skills offered by its Accenture Interactive business.
Headquartered in London with regional offices in New York and Singapore, Brand Learning employs 120 people globally.
The buy out of Brand Learning represents Accenture’s 15th acquisition in five years. The professional services firm continues to make its aggressive play for the digital advertising space through this series of high profile acquisitions, which include the purchase of US digital optimisation company Clearhead on July 13 and UK creative agency Karmarama in November.
Over the past year alone, Accenture has added 1,700 people to its UK workforce, focusing on individuals with digital and technology skills who can work in areas like robotics, AI, data science and virtual reality.
Deliveroo is introducing new safety measures after two delivery riders were among five people injured in north London by acid attacks last month.
Since the attacks, more than 70 Deliveroo riders have said they have not felt safe completing a delivery. Subsequently, Deliveroo has introduced a new app feature that allows riders to instantly raise security concerns to police about specific addresses.
It is also trialling putting cameras on the helmets of riders. The trials will take place in Hackney, east London, which remains a trouble spot for riders.
Uber Eats’ rider Jabed Hussein was the first victim in the series of acid attacks last month. An attack also followed on a Deliveroo rider.
“The safety of our riders is the most important thing to us, and it’s our responsibility as a company to step up our efforts so they can feel safe all of the time,” says Deliveroo’s managing director Dan Darne, who revealed it is also hiring 50 new head office staff to focus specifically on rider safety.

A new study has revealed that male CEOs of the UK’s biggest businesses are earning up to 77% more than their female counterparts. 
Male CEOs of FTSE 100 firms earned, on average, £4.7m in 2016. This compares with a £2.6m average for female bosses, according to the report by the High Pay Centre and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.
In July, ITV announced it was hiring EasyJet’s Carolyn McCall as its new chief executive. But the report says this types of move was rare. Last year, it claims 94 FTSE 100 CEOS were male compared to just 6 women.
“As a FTSE 100 CEO it is more likely that your name is David than you being a female,” the report claims. And this isn’t a joke either; there are currently eight FTSE 100 bosses who go by the name of David.

Barclays has signed up more office space in Dublin as part of its push to expand its operations in the Irish capital following Brexit.
The high street bank has signed a 20-year lease agreement to let 3,437 square metres of office space in central Dublin at a rate of £2.1m a year.
Last month, Bank of America (BofA) announced it had chosen Dublin as it post-Brexit base forinvestment banking and markets operations.
BofA chief executive Brian Moynihan said Dublin is the “natural location to consolidate our legal entities as we transition”.
Analysts believe banks are looking to move out of London as a precaution amid economic uncertainty and due to growing fears that the Brexit negoiations will not reach a positive outcome.

Food giant Mondelez International has announced that the 11-year tenure of its CEO Irene B. Rosenfield is coming to an end. She will be replaced by Dirk Van de Put, who is currently CEO of frozen food giant McCain Foods, in November.
The change in leadership comes at a difficult time for Mondelez. Mondelez’s revenue in its most recent quarter was down 5% from the same period a year earlier, to nearly $6 billion, and its share price is down 2.3% so far this year. It has struggled amid changing eating habits and the demand for healthier products.
Van de Put has previously held senior roles at Mars and Coca-Cola, and Rosenfield talked up his appointment in a statement: “He is a seasoned global C.E.O., having lived and worked on three different continents, with deep experience and expertise in all critical business and commercial operations in both emerging and developed markets.”

According to reports, Apple has patented a method of overlaying details onto real-world environments.
The move, similar to what Google was trying to achieve with Glass, would mean a user could see points of interest such as building names through the naked eye. Effectively, a user can point at buildings and instantly get more information.
The overlay would be designed for iPhone use as well as augmented reality glasses. It stems from Metaio, an AR startup Apple acquired back in 2013.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said the tech giant was working on a “big hardware idea like the smartphone” in a recent interview. Whether that’s augmented reality glasses remains to be seen.

YouTube says new artificial intelligence is driving its efforts to combat terrorist content. In a blog post, the company says new tools are already showing “positive progress”, with the rate that content is removed doubling while accuracy has improved and speed and efficiency has gone up. It claims 75% of violent extremist content is now removed before receiving a human flag.
“We are encouraged by these improvements and will continue to develop our technology in order to make even more progress,” says the company.
Its efforts do not just focus on AI, however. YouTube says it is also hiring more people to help review and enforce policies and is working with more experts, including the Anti-Defamation League and No Hate Speech Movement, to help it better identify offensive or illegal content.
YouTube also plans to introduce tougher standards for content that might not be illegal but has been flagged as potentially violating policies on hate speech and violent extremism. If they don’t violate policies but are still controversial, they will remain on YouTube but behind an interstitial and won’t be recommended, monetised or allow key features such as comments and likes.
Apple has found a way to restore lost momentum after a number of quarters of sales declines as it returned to growth in the second quarter. Revenue was up 6% year on year  to $45.4bn, while profit grew 12% to $8.7bn
Key to the change in fortunes were iPad sales, which were up 15%, the first increase since the end of 2013. iPad revenue was up 2%, suggesting sales of cheaper iPads were the driver of the increase.
iPhone and Mac sales were also up, while its ‘services’ business which includes apps, Apple Music and cloud storage grew by more than 20%. So to did its ‘other products’ division, with sales of products including the Apple Watch, Beats headphones and AirPods also showing growth of more than 20%.

Under Armous plans to cut about 2% of jobs globally as it looks to restructure its business in the face of slowing sales growth. Revenue in the second quarter was up 8.7% to $1.09bn but that is some way below the more than 20% growth it has experienced over the past few years. And the company says it now expects full-year revenue rowth to be between 9% and 11%, down from its previous forecast of 11% to 12%.
As part of its restructuring, Under Armour will cut around 280 jobs, many at its HQ, putting marketers on alert. It also plans to up the speed at which it gets products to market and expand its digital capabilities.
“We’ve identified a number of areas to enhance our operational capabilities, drive process improvement and gain greater efficiencies,” says CEO Kevin Plank.

Amazon has made a big move into sports rights after signing an exclusive deal with the ATP World Tour to show tennis in the UK. The move means Amazon’s Prime Video service will show almost all of the top men’s tennis competitions, other than the four Grand Slams. It beat Sky, which currently holds the rights, with a bid estimated to be worth about £10m a deal, up from the £8m the Guardian estimates Sky paid for its current five-year deal, which expires next year.
The deal marks Amazon’s first live TV sports rights deal outside the US and suggests it could go up against broadcasters to bid for other rights. Premier League rights are up for renewal early next year. Currently worth £5.14bn, Sky and BT, which currently hold the rights, would have been hoping for an end to rapid price increases but a deep-pocketed digital rival such as Amazon could signal even bigger rights competition.

Big UK brands including Rolls Royce, HSBC, Direct Line and BP have made bigger-than-expected profits in the second quarter, raising confidence in the health of big business despite the economic slowdown. According to UBS, profit growth among Britain’s biggest companies was up 20% in the three months to the end of June. It puts that down to a recovery in commodity prices and the depreciation of the pound, which has improved international earnings.
However, Caroline Simmons, deputy head of UK investment at UBS, cautions that the results are mostly a reflection of global economic growth and that Q2 2017 will be the last quarter to benefit from a comparison with a stronger pound before the EU referendum.

Amazon is planning a home makeover show designed to boost shopping on its site.
The ecommerce giant is no stranger to content having produced and distributed TV shows such as ‘Transparent’ and ‘Bosch’ but its focus previously has been on bolstering Amazon Prime subscriptions rather than selling specific products.
The new six-part series called ‘Overhaul’ will feature YouTube stars including baker Rosanna Pansino and beauty blogger Teni Panosian. It will sit in a dedicated hub on Amazon.com, enabling people to click and purchase items in the show, as well as offering more affordable options.
The show is scheduled to launch in September and will also be distributed on the stars’ own YouTube channels and other social platforms, again directing people to Amazon to shop for featured products.
It is being hosted and co-produced by Christiane Lemieux, founder of DwellStudio, and furniture firm Cloth & Company.
“The ‘Overhaul’ series is a great opportunity to provide our customers with some curation and guidance when searching through our large selection of products and we continue to look for new and different ways to do that,” says Kristiana Helmick, director of home innovation at Amazon.
“This is the first time Amazon has had a co-branded storefront tied to a video series.”

L’Oréal plans to shift some of its search budget to Amazon in the UK. Nick Buckley, L’Oréal’s UK digital director, tells Digiday that while Amazon’s share of its search budget is still in the single digits, he expects “this spend to grow” as the volume of searches increases.
According to Buckley, 38% of all beauty searches start on Amazon, but rather than using it to drive sales he believes Amazon’s role is to help the cosmetics giant better identify customer trends.
Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, believes Amazon is a huge threat to Google when it comes to search. In March, he said: “It’s early days with Amazon, you never know what’s going to happen. But we put together an agency in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered, specifically to deal and cater to them.”
Talking to Marketing Week earlier this year, Lars Glenne, head of media strategy at DigitasLBi, said: “Advertisers are realising that Amazon’s search intent is in many cases more valuable [than Google’s] as it happens further down the purchase funnel, in comparison to Google search, where people are more likely to be doing a search at the beginning of their purchase journeys.”

US TV network Fox plans to replicate the success of YouTube’s six-second ad format, with both Mars and Duracell prepping two six-second spots to air during the ‘Teen Choice Awards’ later this month.
Fox Networks Group revealed plans to roll out six-second ads on its digital and on-demand products during the Cannes Lions Festival in June, but it will roll out the format on TV less than two months later.
The six-second ads will run as part of shorter, 29-second ad breaks featuring a five-second intro message asking people not to turn over because the show will be back in less than 30 seconds. This will be followed by four six-second spots.
Fox will air longer ads in separate, more traditional ad breaks alongside at least four of the 29-second commercial breaks.

Retailers would be happy to see the spending limit for contactless payments raised as three quarters currently using the system have seen an uplift in transactions of 30% on average, according to research by Barclaycard.
Consumers can currently spend up to £30 via the contactless system but more than half of retailers want to see the limit increased, with one in five suggesting it should be raised to £100.
The limit was lifted to £30 in September 2015 having previously been set at £20.

Mobike, the successful Chinese bike-sharing scheme, is set to give Santander Bikes a run for its money when it launches in London in September, just weeks after being trialed in Manchester.
The scheme operates a pick-up-and-ride system that does not rely on the docking stations used by ‘Boris bikes’.
Users must pay an initial deposit of £29 and will then be charged 50p per half hour. Bikes can be booked an app and are unlocked using a QR code. A GPS system is fitted to each bicycle to help locate and monitor the condition of bikes.
Chinese internet giant Tencent is an investor in Mobike, and part of what corporate vice-president Steven Chang calls “the Tencent family”.

HSBC’s profits rose 5% in the first half of the year after a turbulent 2016.
The results were better than expected with Europe’s largest bank reporting that its pre-tax profit for the first six months to June came in at $10.2bn (£7.8bn), compared with $9.7bn (£7.4bn) for the same period last year.
The bank has been on a recovery drive over the last two years to streamline the business and reduce costs. It has laid off tens of thousands of staff and shifted more of its focus towards Asia.
HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said there were still “uncertainties arising from increasing geopolitical tensions and ambiguous predictions around the shape of transition to, and final form of, the UK’s future relationship with its major trading partners in the EU” post-Brexit, but described HSBC’s performance as “resilient”.
HSBC confirmed earlier this year that it may have to move 1,000 roles from London to Paris due to Brexit over the next couple of years.

Hate having a slow internet connection? MPs do too. A new Government report is calling on Ofcom, the media and telecoms regulator, to get tough on broadband providers that promise fast speeds but fail to deliver.
The British infrastruture group of MPs, led by former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps, estimates that as many as 6.7m UK broadband connections may not hit the 10Mb minimum that the Government wants to be the UK standard for a basic decent service.
The Broadband 2.0 report, which is backed by 57 MPs, calls for automatic compensation for customers who do not get the level of speed promised from the internet packages they buy.
“Although broadband is increasingly considered to be an essential utility, the quality of customer services has simply not caught up with demand,” said Shapps. “It is unacceptable that there are still no minimum standards in the UK telecoms sector to protect customers from protracted complaints procedures, and ensure that broadband providers are fully accountable to their customers.”

BT has said it will invest up to £600m to bring broadband to the UK’s rural areas in a bid to avoid tougher regulation.
It wants to get 99% of the country connected to broadband of at least 10Mb by 2020, a speed that’s considered good enough to stream films, use video chat and browsing online at the same time.
The proposals put forward to the Government by the telecoms firm come after the right to request a minimum broadband service was made possible under new laws.
“We are pleased to make a voluntary offer to deliver the government’s goal for universal broadband access at minimum speeds of 10Mb,” said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson.
“This investment will reinforce the UK’s status as the leading digital economy in the G20. We already expect 95% of homes and businesses to have access to superfast broadband speeds of 24Mbp or faster by the end of 2017. Our latest initiative aims to ensure that all UK premises can get faster broadband, even in the hardest to reach parts of the UK.”

SoundCloud has had a rough couple of months. There has been a lot of talk in the press of mismanagement, and the business has laid off almost half of its staff.
Bloomberg has since revealed that the music streaming service is in “advanced” talks to sell stakes in the company to two private equity firms.
If the deals go through, it will be a bittersweet moment for the company. While it will manage to stay afloat, it would also hand majority control to outside companies. In essence, SoundCloud would be giving up its vaunted independence in order to keep the lights on.

The number of women earning more than £1m a year has doubled in the five years to 2014-2015, but they are still outnumbered by men by a ratio of 10 to one.
Women make up 9.2% of those earning above £1m, according to an analysis of tax returns filed in 2014-15, and derived from a freedom of information request made to Revenue & Customs.
The figures, requested by financial advisor firm Salisbury House Wealth, show the number has doubled over five years, to 1,400, compared to 13,800 men.
“The [data] really clearly shows the gulf between what men and women earn when you get those top jobs,” said Sam Smethers, chief executive of The Fawcett Society, which promotes gender equality and women’s rights.
“It’s not that surprising but the difference is really stark when you look at the numbers.”
The tax data also show that more women are becoming entrepreneurs. More than 1.6m women were self-employed in the first quarter of this year, compared with 1.2m in 2011.

P&G’s decision to cut digital ad spend last quarter shows too many brands are still wasting money on ineffective digital ads.
The telecoms giant is changing its advertising style to take a more emotional approach in a bid to become more “relevant” to consumers’ lives.
The launch of ‘Fitwater’ is aimed at a gap in the market for “functional” water and looks to encourage people to trade up from tap water.

Brands are increasingly turning to automated research techniques to prune the market of poor methodologies, toxic panels and anecdotal results, but there will always be a need for human analysis.
Machines are being used to automate a rising number of processes in the marketing world. Programmatic ad buying, artificial intelligence, chatbots and other emerging technologies are changing the landscape and bringing with them new efficiencies and ways of working.
It follows then, that market research also stands to benefit from automation. One such example is the use of robots to test the effectiveness of advertising.
Brands want answers to specific creative campaign questions before their activity starts (around messaging and execution), while it is live (to assess how the target audience is responding) and when completed (to determine what ROI it has delivered).
Automation improves the accuracy of this kind of research, speeds up the collection of data and can save brands money. It also makes ad testing more intuitive and should mean human researchers can spend more time analysing the results to produce the actionable insight that brands crave.
READ MORE: Artificial intelligence: A force for good or evil?
One British multinational to invest in a fully-automated creative testing process is Reckitt Benckiser (RB), owner of brands including Dettol, Durex and Cillit Bang.
It is working with market research technology provider ZappiStore to improve ad testing results. By automating processes it has been able to increase the number of ads it tests in a year by 77%, from 188 to 333, which has resulted in a 14% jump in market effectiveness. Previously the business focused primarily on analysing the effectiveness of TV commercials but it now examines creativity across Facebook, point of sale and online video.
Automation allows large brand owners to think and act with the agility of a startup.
The company has also increased the number of brands it can evaluate from 25 to 32, which has improved overall ad effectiveness from 45% to 59%.
Mathilde Levy, RB’s senior consumer and market insight manager for Europe and the US, says automation has made a big difference.
“In the FMCG world there is the internal clock of the marketing function and the external clock of the life of the customer. These two clocks are not always synchronised,” she says. “By using automation the internal clock is more in tune and allows large brand owners to think and act with the agility of a startup.”
The company is keen to introduce automation into other areas of its research, such as qualitative work enabling more interviews to be carried out in people’s homes using machines.
“Automation is also removing barriers internally,” says Levy. “The research we provide is not always as timely as marketers want it to be and we can be regarded as blockers. Automation changes this. Instead of serving as a validation function and being the policemen, we become more of a consultant, providing insight that can help to drive the business forward.”
RB is now looking to upgrade its automated efforts, which will enable its brand marketers to cross-compare previous studies with new ones to reveal trends that would previously have cost too much time and money to uncover.
For Dominic Grounsell, former global marketing director at Travelex and Marketing Society board member, it is the improved accuracy provided by automation which appeals.
“I am not a fan of traditional quantitative and qualitative research methods and interviews on street corners that provide unnatural reactions when people are pressured for time,” he says. “Things have evolved, with tools such as neuroscience technology assessing the emotional impact of an ad or messaging.”
He also points to the development of mobile phone tracking in providing more reliable analytics.
“The more brands use [smartphones] to track consumer behaviour on a granular level the better answers they will get to more specific questions on where people go and how long they spend there.”
Grounsell believes technology that provides retailers with real-time location-based behavioural data about consumers, will be a huge help to marketers going forward. “You can actually see people walking into a restaurant or a retailer, which provides a greater understanding of footfall,” he says.
It is the ability to understand consumer reactions in the moment that prompted the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) to begin conducting real-time fan research during races, enabling it to improve the experience for viewers and advertisers.
The organisation, which sanctions more than 1,200 races across the US, Canada, Mexico and Europe, understood that people watch with their friends, chat about the races on social media and engaging with sponsors while drivers battle it out but needed to be part of the conversation in order to learn from it. 
Working with machine learning platform Remesh, NASCAR has been able to engage statistically significant number of fans simultaneously to drive research. It works by a single moderator asking an open-ended question about a specific moment to the entire community but results in members of the fan council responding individually, providing qualitative data that NASCAR can then analyse.
People are complex, and to capture this complexity you need a human element.
Fans are asked for their views on which manufacturer has the most attractive car, what they think about the companies advertising and how they rate the race on a scale of one to 10.
While some of the techniques outlined above are new, many brands have been using aspects of automation in market research for years. Transport for London (TfL), for example, started using online quantitative methods to evaluate its different marketing campaigns 13 years ago.
TfL is now employing an element of automation in its qualitative work, via online discussion forums, and it has introduced mobile apps into its ethnographic research so customers can record their own experiences in real time.
TfL’s customer insight manager Ian Pring welcomes the benefits of automation but says it is not time yet to lose the human element of market research completely.
“TfL isn’t just about running a transport system, we are a customer service business and we’re aware that people don’t always report their behaviour, thoughts and feelings in a straightforward way,” he says. “People are complex, and to capture this complexity you need a human element, not just in qualitative fieldwork but in analysis, interpretation and integration of all customer insights.”

In the publishing sector Trinity Mirror’s group’s marketing director Zoe Harris says there is an internal debate on whether the automated analytics it uses for online brands would work for its print products.
“Our editor-in-chief Lloyd Embley observes that if we used the same analysis for print as we do for online we would put the crossword on the front page,” says Harris. “Many people turn to it first and it’s the piece of content that people spend the most time engaged with.”
There is a serious point to this observation. It demonstrates how in any content-driven business the data generated must inform long-term thinking and be authentic.
“If all the research was automated it would not be as genuine. One of our most traditional and trusted methods of research is our postbag,” says Harris.
Automation should be viewed as just another tool we can use as we try to do more with the same research budget.
Trinity Mirror also has its 10,000-strong online research community Mouthpiece, which brings together readers and web visitors from more than 20 of its national and regional news brands. This provides feedback on how the big news stories are being covered and how people are feeling about the country or politics.
“The research is informing our advertisers to help them get their content right,” says Harris. “We have seen, for instance, a shift from a north/south divide to more of a London versus the rest of the UK split. Brands need insight into underlying trends to remain in touch with mainstream Britain.”
When it comes to automated ad testing, she does worry that it hinders creativity.
“Some of the best ad campaigns are the ones that initially test badly. Automation should be viewed as just another tool we can use as we try to do more with the same research budget.”
The speed of change in research automation is almost as rapid as NASCAR champion Kyle Busch flying around the Kentucky Speedway track at July’s Alsco 300. However, for the immediate future at least, robots and human researchers will co-exist so that brands benefit from the accuracy and pace of using computers without losing the creativity and gut feel of a real person.
If machine learning is so clever, why does Spotify recommend such rubbish songs and Amazon suggest the stuff I already own in different colours?
Should marketers fear for their jobs or embrace the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, so they can adapt now and stay relevant in the future?

Inspiring customers is high on every marketer’s agenda but to realise great marketing, inspiring your organisation may matter even more.
When I’m not speaking at conferences, I sometimes teach masterclasses to help marketers raise their boardroom profile.
Not long ago, a technology firm asked me to extend one of my marketing leadership keynotes into a class for 30 of their senior marketing clients. The firm had come to realise that the best marketing software goes nowhere unless marketers get buy-in internally. I couldn’t agree more.
Why waste money on artificial intelligence in online campaigning when your sales team keeps filling your customers’ inboxes with uncoordinated parallel emails? Why install fancy customer experience software when your front-line staff are demotivated and treat people accordingly?
READ MORE: Thomas Barta – Customer experience is a marketer’s biggest leadership challenge
Success as a marketing leader is mostly about mobilising others – but many marketers find mobilising difficult.
What I didn’t know was this marketing leadership masterclass would become one of my most memorable ever.
We kicked off with some group therapy, complaining about how difficult things are in marketing. “We’re currently going through a massive transformation” was the most commonly heard sentence. Change, it seems, is the new normal in marketing.
After shifting into productive mode, we analysed marketing’s zone of influence and tested powerful marketing leadership techniques like storytelling, walking the halls, and co-creation.
The highlight of this masterclass, however, came at the end when participants got up one at a time in front of the whole group to give a ‘change’ speech for all staff. These were very personal talks about where people wanted their organisation to go: why, how, and what’s next.
If you want your customers to feel prouder, or healthier, or better served then that’s your message in every meeting, every talk, every important document.
The first two speeches went well, earning friendly applause. The third talk stopped everybody in their tracks. A young B2B hardware marketer stepped to the front. An introvert, she hadn’t been too visible during the class, and people didn’t know what to expect. How exciting could B2B hardware be?
For a moment she collected her thoughts, and then she stunned everybody. In a short speech, she appealed to her company’s staff to bring back what she believed mattered most for their customers: pride.
She shared the story of a customer who talked with enthusiasm about his new toolkit. “I didn’t realise how personally important our tools are for customers – how proud they can make them.”
She concluded with a series of initiatives that would add to the customers’ sense of pride: more confident packaging, bolder design, aspirational sales catalogues, supportive call centre dialogues, and a new customer-exchange network. “We must always remember: when our tools make people proud, we’re unbeatable.”
You could hear a pin drop when she ended. And then enthusiastic applause broke out. When I asked for feedback, one participant hit the nail on the head: “It seemed like you really mean it.”
‘You really mean it’, to me, best summarises what it takes to inspire other people. As a marketer, almost everybody around you can say no to your ideas: your colleagues, your bosses – even your team members. Your biggest mobilising asset is your ability to inspire. People don’t have to follow you. But if you sincerely inspire them – if you really mean it – you have a chance they’ll join your cause.
Here’s the good news: every marketer can be inspirational. There’s only one condition – you have to be inspired first.
READ MORE: Marketers lack professional role models to inspire their careers
What do you stand for? After I give keynotes, I often ask people to share with me their most burning priorities. Many talk about an overdue job promotion or the lack of a sense of purpose in their role.
If I were to ask these people’s colleagues ‘What does this person stand for?’, I might hear things like ‘ambition’ or ‘having a cool life’. There’s nothing wrong with that. But would I be keen to follow these marketers? Probably not.
Almost every marketing role holds amazing inspiration potential. I’m always baffled when marketers complain about a lack of purpose.
Make a conscious effort to show the fire in your eyes.
I get the purpose-issue when you work as a human slave in a mine or as an underpaid grunt just to pay your bills. But in marketing, unless you sell a seriously damaging product (and then, I guess, you must have strong reasons to do so), you can always understand customers better, serve them better, make better products for them. Why not start here?
Unilever’s Paul Polman has set himself and his company on an aspirational course to improve the quality of people’s lives. When Paul talks, you can see the fire in his eyes. His passion is not only believable, it’s contagious.
To be fair, when you’re in charge of in-store promotions, Polman-like inspirations can look pretty far-fetched; and when your day job doesn’t square with a highly Instagram-able purpose, you might get stuck. If that’s happened to you, it’s time to get unstuck.
If you haven’t found your inspiration yet, here’s a tip from my masterclass: imagine you’ll be leaving your company 12 months from now. I’m your customer. How will you have made my life a little bit better? Think about your customers first. Start small. Generate a few ideas. Perhaps none of these ideas will sound dazzling. Never mind. Pick one and push it for a while. See how big you can make it.
The year before McKinsey elected me as a partner, a senior colleague told me: “I love your work, but you are super uninspiring.” I was puzzled. How could I go the extra mile, over-deliver, and then be uninspiring? This was seriously chilling news. I was a telecoms marketing expert, but that wasn’t the point; people wanted to know what I was burning for.
My idea at the time was to make telecoms companies more customer-focused. But I didn’t think that purpose was grand enough to share with my colleagues – I didn’t believe it was even remotely exciting. I was wrong.
When I made my purpose front and centre, it not only inspired me more, it inspired the people around me. (Looking at today’s telecoms firms, I’m unsure how significant my impact was, but that’s for another article.)
Once you know what inspires you, double down on it. Make every interaction count. That’s what marketing means. If you want your customers to feel prouder, or healthier, or better served then that’s your message in every meeting, every talk, every important document. Make a conscious effort to show the fire in your eyes.
A few days ago, I followed up with the B2B marketer who had told the inspirational story in our masterclass. While she felt it was still early, she already counted two wins. She got a slot to speak at the next sales leaders’ conference. And she was invited to help redesign the call centre training, the first marketer ever to do so. “When I first told my story,” she said, “I was pretty nervous. It took all my courage, but it worked surprisingly well”.
As a marketing leader, being inspired gives you the courage to do what all customer leaders should do: think about customers, scrap your job description and do what’s right. So, what’s the fire in your eyes?
Unless marketers step up and take the lead, great customer experiences will remain a corporate fantasy.
For marketers to overcome strong beliefs inside the company, showing facts may not be enough. Your better bet is to ask a powerful question: “How, exactly?”
Coca-Cola’s ditching of its chief marketing officer role for a chief growth officer is a clear warning to CMOs: stand for growth, or lose it all. Thomas Barta, co-author of ‘The 12 Powers of a Marketing Leader’, explains.
Learning about your industry and competitors will improve your effectiveness but we often don’t prioritise it. Here are some strategies for making the time.

As sites such as Instagram roll out buy buttons, the online retailer’s CEO admits social could be a “drag” going forward and that their impact isn’t straightforward.
Asos has admitted that while it relies heavily on social media to communicate with and market to its millions of customers, its relationship with sites such as Facebook and Instagram is not always straightforward.
Speaking on a results call yesterday (13 July) following Asos’s third quarter results, CEO Nick Beighton said: “[Going forward] we don’t know whether [social media] will be a drag or an enabler. But certainly with potential buy buttons coming through social media, they are actually attempting to capture the customer journey; that’s a potential threat but also an enabler.”
Beighton added that there is not a “binary answer” as to whether social media would continue to have a positive impact on the company. Asos has more than 20 million followers on social media on “every conceivable channel” because Beighton believes it is important to be wherever its customers are.
And despite concerns about the threat it could pose, Asos plans to migrate more of its marketing effort from email to social.

“Email is still a very effective communications tool but actually we’ll be migrating far more of that through social, some of which is free, paid social and through digital marketing,” explained Beighton.
“We’ll also just re-evaluate what we do with marketing going forward, the role of marketing and whether we try out some things we haven’t tried for a while.”
Beighton’s comments come as Asos’s sales surged in the four months to the end of June on the back of strong international sales and Asos holding its price when other online retailers increased theirs.
The retailer also credited its focus on customer experience, which Beighton said had “moved to a whole different game” due to artificial intelligence (AI) and data science.
“Every customers that comes through the app is getting a better experience the next time they come in and actually the journey they are following is enhancing the journey for the next person. That’s where data usage through data science and AI will go,” he said.
Asos implemented 300 tech updates (not including things like bug fixes) in the quarter and Beighton expects this number to rise as the pace of change in digital increases. For example, visual search is now live in the UK and the retailer is using AI and data to personalise that further.

It is also testing a virtual assistant – dubbed Ava (for Asos virtual assistant) – that Beighton called “pretty amazing” and is using data and AI tech to give customers greater confidence in the sizes of its products.
“We have continued to innovate at an even faster pace across all areas of our business, from product to technology to proposition. This sets us up really well for the future,” Beighton concluded.
The ecommerce giant is hoping to make major inroads into fashion retail with the launch of a new tailored delivery service.
The fashion brand’s head of marketing analytics says brands should not prioritise targeting as a strategy and ignore reach.
Great personalisation cannot be too reliant on analysing a consumer’s past behaviours, according to Asos.

The gas and electricity provider says it can be difficult convincing a board to invest in AI-based technology such as chatbots.
First Utility claims businesses need more clarity on which department looks after artificial intelligence innovations such as chatbots.
Speaking at Marketing Week’s Supercharged event today (4 July), the gas and electricity provider’s lead software engineer Natalia Konstantinova said there are still big questions around who is best suited to lead internal AI projects.
“Is it marketing or customer support?” she asked. “Who are the people who say ‘we need to add this content into the solution, and make these edits’, and are in the middle of gathering this information all over the company? If you have a new tariff or news, [they] need to be in the middle collecting this.”
The brand created its own chatbot three years ago out of necessity after finding that relying solely on its call centres was “inefficient” as they were dealing with the strain of a 670% surge in new customers over a five-year period. It claims it was the first within the home utilities sector to launch a chatbot to deal with customer queries.
First Utility’s chatbot has different use cases, and can answer general questions around topics such as smart meters, as well as have multi-layered conversations around meter readings, tariff comparisons and a customer’s bills.

However, Konstantinova admitted it was “tricky” persuading board members to invest in artificial intelligence in the first place. That said, she now believes it is easier for others to make a business case due to “all of your competitors doing it.”
Others speaking at the event were more cynical about the benefits of chatbots. Nicola Millard, customer insights and futurology at BT Global Services, said she believes that despite the “hype” around chatbots, they are currently only useful for “basic” tasks and are only as good as a company’s data.
She concluded: “It’s more difficult to use for complaints and complexity. If we get angry , we tend to tell long, rambling stories that are hard to analyse. Sarcasm also tends to throw algorithms, as it has a limited ability to detect the emotional context.”
“meter” and “metre” are different words.
First Utility has launched a new campaign today (4 January) in a bid to ‘call out’ the big six suppliers and grow its market share further with a brand position that aims to engage and empower consumers.
First Utility has previously positioned itself as a challenger to the ‘big six’ energy providers but the brand’s CMO thinks it can be known for much more than that.
Challenger energy brand First Utility is looking to tackle the inert market that sees the Big Six utility firms take advantage of customer disengagement through its first national TV campaign, which highlights the added value and services it promises to offer.
By solely focusing on demographics or socioeconomic status, brands could be ignoring key consumers willing to part with their cash.

The marketing news that matters this week includes Google being hit with a record fine, Tesco getting rid of some of its marketers and Wimbledon launching its first AI assistant.
If you work for Google then you probably can’t wait for this week to be over.
Why? Well, earlier this week, Google was hit with a record €2.42bn (£2.1bn) fine for breaching EU antitrust rules, and has been told to end its improper conduct within 90 days or face penalty payments of up to 5% of the average daily turnover of parent company Alphabet.
The European Commission’s Margrethe Vestager, who is in charge of competition policy, explained: “Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors. It denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.”
Google – surprise, surprise – said it “respectfully disagrees” with the ruling. However, this fine along with The Times investigation, which has made dozens of brands drop their ad spend from YouTube, means many marketers are now starting to seriously question Google’s conduct for perhaps the first time.

Marketers need to make their ad spend stretch as far as possible and Santander thinks it has found just the solution.
This week, it told Marketing Week how it’s integrating a new marketing strategy inspired by Agile software development, most commonly used in IT and Silicon Valley as a collaborative way to find solutions, as it looks to boost the efficiency of spend and marketing effectiveness.
The strategy uses ‘sprints’ to constantly evaluate the performance of the advertising with the aim of ensuring the efficiency of creative and media. It means Santander will be adapting and tweaking the campaign on a weekly basis, a much shorter timescale than usually used hence the name sprints, in reaction to how well it performs based on feedback from consumers.
“The industry has, unfortunately, been constructed around things like long booking deadlines or production cycles and that is what we want to change,” explained Santander’s CMO Keith Moor of the banking brand’s new approach. “It has to change because that is not the way the world works.” Sound logic, right? If the new strategy works, expect others to follow Santander’s lead.

While a lot has been written about VR and how it will change the world, Wimbledon seems more bothered by the impact of artificial intelligence and mixed reality. For this year’s imminent tournament, Wimbledon is introducing AI assistant Fred, which is powered by IBM Watson technology, as an option within its official app.
Fred, named after legendary British tennis player Fred Perry, will work by allowing visitors on site to ask it questions such as directions and where restaurants are. And Alexandra Willis, head of communications, content  and digital at the All English Lawn Tennis Club, says the plan is to expand the AI assistant over the coming years so it can answer questions such as the history of players or whether it’s going to rain with a level of intuition similar to something like Siri.
Willis told Marketing Week: “Sometimes people have no idea how much they can do at Wimbledon so Fred gives them the chance to really interrogate and ask questions so they make the most out of the experience.
“One of the big challenges for a sport like tennis is on the analytics and data side it is very much a push experience for tennis fans right now. So, while this year Fred is all about the visitor experience, we see the potential in terms of rolling it out to the broader Wimbledon fan over the coming years and helping reshape the viewing experience”
Willis also claimed “the appetite for people wearing a VR headset for an entire match of tennis isn’t particularly high” and said Wimbledon was still waiting for the technology to catch up. Suddenly brands don’t seem quite as sweet on VR, hmmm.

Danone is aiming to develop a portfolio of “manifesto brands” that reflect the company’s commitment to deliver a positive food future.
The French diary giant, which spans a stable of brands including Activia yoghurt and Evian mineral water, is using its new ‘One Planet, One Health’ positioning to communicate the company’s desire to help consumers make healthier choices.
Its CEO Emmanuel Faber calls told Marketing Week: “This is really about a movement that goes beyond the question of sustainability. What we’re suggesting is a pretty radical new approach to support people in their choice for healthier and more sustainable eating.”
The new brand identity, including a revamped logo, will appear in all Danone corporate communications by the end of 2018, while the roll-out across the brand portfolio will be a more gradual process.
What’s interesting is that the positioning is based on a manifesto written by Danone employees over a two-year period. Some 50,000 people from the global workforce connected to discuss the grassroots campaign via the company’s Facebook at Work social platform.
“The whole concept behind this movement, which we are calling food sovereignty, is for us to surrender control and give the power back to people, and how credible would we be to say that to our consumers if we don’t start with our employees?” added Faber.
While a lot of brands claim to listen to their employees, few prove it in such an open way.

Tesco cut 1,200 jobs at its head office this week, as part of an ongoing cost-cutting drive. Although the supermarket giant refused to single out the level of roles set to be axed in each individual department affected, it did confirm there would be job losses “across all functions” including marketing.
The cuts mean around 25% of staff at Tesco’s head office in Welwyn Garden City will lose their jobs. And they come just a week after Tesco revealed it would cut 1,100 jobs due to shutting down a customer support centre in Cardiff.
“This new service model will simplify the way we organise ourselves, reduce duplication and cost but also, very importantly, allow us to invest in serving shoppers better,” said a spokesman.
The news is perhaps unsurprising, with Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis cutting thousands of jobs and product lines since taking the reigns in 2014. Last April, for example, Tesco put 3,000 jobs at risk after announcing plans to end 24-hour opening at 69 of its stores, while Tesco has significantly refined its product ranges.
Yet, with Tesco one of the UK’s most major businesses, others will be watching its moves closely and wondering whether a more streamlined approach could also work for them as well. Interestingly, Tesco is growing its sales currently, so the cuts are not coming during a period of decline. The move suggests it sees a reduction as crucial to continuing its current run of sixth consecutive quarters of sales growth.

With new data protection laws coming into force next year and machine learning gaining pace it is time for marketers to get up to speed with developments in AI.
Bud Light is being relaunched in the UK, 16 years after the last attempt ended in failure.
Facebook is transforming its Messenger platform to work as a contact book for consumers, and looks to attract brands by allowing them to contact consumers directly.

In the next instalment of ‘Digital Decoded’ Marketing Week explores the latest technology that enables marketers to understand real life patterns.
With so much going on in consumers’ lives, understanding their moves and motivations can be difficult.
In the next episode of Marketing Week’s ‘Digital Decoded’ series Mindi Chahal speaks to Ofri Ben Porat, the co-founder and CEO of Pixoneye, which uses artificial intelligence technology to anonymously scan photos on people’s smartphones.
It allows brands to more effectively track moments, such as a potential house move, through real-life pictures, enabling marketers to target consumers based on actual evidence rather than looking at previous purchase behaviour.
Digital metrics are a mess of confusion and obfuscation, but it’s clear most marketers have bought into this opaque and over-complicated world.
French food group Danone is hoping to spark a revolution with a new brand identity focused on the future of food.
Data leads thinking, planning and budget allocation in a digital world but how can brands ensure they are getting a true measure of success across platforms, channels and devices?
Both Apple and Google are introducing new ad blocking tech, but it is Apple’s focus on retargeting and making an ad-free experience part of its premium positioning that should concern marketers.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.
The laundry app’s chief Ed Relf on building brands by focusing on trust and why marketers make the best entrepreneurs.

The Google memo by engineer James Damore, attacking the company for pursuing gender diversity, shows how damaging it is to make sex-based assumptions – but it also reveals big political problems for the web giant.

Nike is launching a pilot programme with Amazon to sell products on the company’s website.
The sportswear giant will carry a limited range of footwear, accessories and apparel on the site.
Nike confirmed the deal after its latest quarterly results briefing which saw the brand post better than expected profit and sales. Its share price also rose 8.2% to $57.54 following the announcement.
Nike’s chief executive, Mark Parker, said: “We’re looking for ways to improve the Nike consumer experience on Amazon by elevating the way the brand is presented and increasing the quality of product storytelling.”

Instagram has introduced a filter that automatically prevents offensive or inappropriate comments from appearing, in order to reduce spam in comments and to help keep Instagram a “safe place for self-expression”.
“Many of you have told us that toxic comments discourage you from enjoying Instagram and expressing yourself freely. To help, we’ve developed a filter that will block certain offensive comments on posts and in live video,” said Kevin Systrom CEO & co-founder of Instagram.
“We believe that using machine learning to build tools to safeguard self-expression is an important step in fostering more inclusive, kinder communities.”
The tech firm will use advanced machine learning technology to detect and filter out comments so the user never has to see them. It will be rolled out in English first.

Garnier pledges to #CommitToCare with the launch of a new three-year partnership with Unicef.
The worldwide tie-up will help 300,000 children living in danger to play, learn and receive basic healthcare in designated safe spaces.
The partnership will also deliver 5,600 emergency kits in the first year to vulnerable children affected by conflicts and disasters worldwide.
It has been set up to protect the one in four children worldwide that lives in danger, often because of natural disaster or conflict.
“Garnier is committed to caring for future generations, and Unicef is doing phenomenal work to help children in danger, providing them with the essentials for survival and security, and giving them the confidence to build a brighter future,” said Karen Flavard Jones, Garnier general manager UK and Ireland.
Google has hired Danielle Brown, Intel’s former head of diversity, as its vice-president of diversity. Brown, who left Intel at the start of the month, will begin her new role in July. She will be responsible for managing the diversity and inclusion strategy at the company.
“While we’ve made progress in recent years for both women and people of colour, there are areas for improvement across the board in terms of our hiring, our promotion and retention, our commitments, our working environment, and how we measure success or failure,” Eileen Naughton, vice-president of people operations at Google said in a blogpost confirming the role.

Online grocer Ocado has conducted the UK’s first trial of autonomous grocery deliveries.
The small CargoPod vehicle will spend the next 10 days delivering food and snacks to Ocado customers who live in the Woolwich area.
A customer is notified when the CargoPod is loaded up, from a “mobile warehouse” located around a mile from their home, and then again once it has reached their front door. They then press a button to unlock their box and collect their shopping bag.
The idea is that if the trial is successful, Ocaco will then outsource its “smart platform” technology – a driverless food delivery concept – to grocers such as Walmart and Amazon Fresh.
Ocado, which was founded in April 2000, has grown to a valuation of almost £2bn.

From driverless to something more traditional; the number of cars rolling off UK production lines has plunged, according to new data.
Trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says 136,119 new cars were built in Britain in May – a fall of 9.7% on the same month in 2016.
Domestic demand has taken a hit and compared with a year ago, new cars destined for British roads fell by 12.8% in May, while those for export came in 9% lower.
Falling demand in the UK is widely attributed to consumer fears about the health of the economy in the wake of the Brexit vote and uncertainty about Britain leaving the EU.
“Maintaining our current open trade links with Europe, our biggest market, and further developing global markets is vital for this sector,” says Mike Hawes, CEO of SMMT.

When Facebook launched its eBay-esque Marketplace feature last October many scratched their heads. However, according to new data shared by the social media giant, the feature has proven to be successful.
It says more than 18 million new items were posted for sale to Marketplace in the US alone in May, with the most popular categories currently: furniture, babies and kids, and women’s clothing.
It also claims May saw a 77% rise in the number of unique conversations between a potential buyer and seller. And according to Facebook, a whopping 550 million of its users visit its buy-and-sell groups monthly.
If these numbers continue to grow, don’t expect Marketplace to be Facebook’s last ecommerce experiment.

After finding that 80% of countries don’t have laws against animal testing within the cosmetics industry, The Body Shop has teamed up with pet influencers to raise awareness in a campaign that will run until 2020.
The ‘Forever Against Animal Campaign’ will team up with famous pets such as Tuna, a chiweenie with nearly two million Instagram followers, and popular accounts such as DogsOfInstagram, with the accounts agreeing to regularly post about the campaign’s aims.
These aims include collecting eight million signatures so The Body Shop can sign a petition urging the U.N. to ban all animal testing in cosmetics globally.
“It makes so much sense from a brand standpoint,” says Andrea Blieden, vp of marketing for The Body Shop. “The Body Shop has a significant amount of awareness all over the world, but it doesn’t hit every single person, and so we are using these influencers to broaden our reach and scope. It makes the cause relevant to people who care about their pets.”

Premium grocer Waitroser will launch a new customer magazine, Waitrose Drinks, to add to a portfolio that already includes Waitrose Food, Waitrose Weekend and Waitrose Garden.
The new magazine will explore a wide array of ciders, wines, beers and spirits, highlighting the best through news and features.
Ollie Rice, Editor in Chief, Waitrose, says: “We’re thrilled to be adding Waitrose Drinks to our range. The drinks industry is really growing with exciting products emerging all the time, from craft beer to unusual varieties of gin.”
Waitrose Weekend, a free newspaper, already has a weekly circulation of 415,000 and the grocer says print has “boosted loyalty” among its consumers.
More than two billion people are now using Facebook every month, according to the company.
The only other platforms above 1 billion are YouTube (1.5 billion) and Facebook’s own WhatsApp and Messenger apps.
Further stats released by Facebook show that over 800 million people globally ‘like’ something on Facebook every day, while in the UK more than three million friendships are made per day.
Alongside this news, the brand is also releasing new features, including ‘Good Adds Up’ personalised videos, which features inspiring stories of people using Facebook to bring communities together. After someone reacts to a friend’s post by clicking on ‘Love’, wishes someone happy birthday or creates a group, they will see a message in their News Feed thanking them.
Ice from three of the UK’s biggest coffee chains has been found to contain bacteria from faeces, according to a BBC investigation.
Samples of iced drinks from Costa Coffee, Starbucks and Caffe Nero contained varying levels of the bacteria, the BBC’s Watchdog found.
Seven out of 10 samples of Costa ice were found to be contaminated with bacteria found in faeces. At both Starbucks and Caffe Nero, three out of 10 samples tested contained the bacteria known as faecal coliforms.
Tony Lewis, head of policy at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, says these kinds of bacteria are “opportunistic pathogens – the source of human disease.”
All three chains affected say they have now taken action, with Starbucks and Caffe Nero launching their own investigation and Costa claiming it has updated its ice-handling guidelines.

Media companies should consider prioritising quality, trust and self-regulation as consumers raise concerns over fake news, according to the annual KPMG Media Tracker report.
Some 50% of respondents to the survey of 2,000 UK adults said they were concerned with the accuracy of news they read online. Just 12% said they were not worried by the issue.
The research, which was conducted by Populus and supported by IHS Markit, revealed that trust was identified as the most common factor that respondents considered when consuming news online.
TV ranked as the most reliable media source with nearly two-thirds (65%) of those surveyed saying they trusted it (while 13% distrust the medium). It was also named as the most popular source of news for the over 35s. In comparison, only 17% of respondents trust what they read on social media.
Businessman Sir Philip Green sold the BHS business to dodge responsibility for its insolvent pension schemes if the firm should go bust, the Pensions Regulator says.
The claim is made by the regulator in its report on the sale of BHS in 2015 and its collapse a year later. In February, Sir Philip agreed, after months of pressure, to pay £363m into the BHS pension schemes.
A spokesman for Sir Philip said only “the matter is now closed”.
The sale of BHS for £1 in early 2015, and its collapse a year later along with its two pension schemes, led to one of the biggest pension scandals of the past decade.

L’Oréal is selling The Body Shop to Brazilian cosmetics maker Natura Cosméticos, as it seeks to grow internationally.
“L’Oréal announces that the contract for the sale of The Body Shop to Natura was signed,” L’Oréal said in a statement on Tuesday. “The proposed sale is subject to clearance by antitrust authorities notably in Brazil and in the United States, and expected to close during 2017.”
The deal gives the British chain with locations around the world an enterprise value of €1bn.
“The acquisition of The Body Shop is a decisive step in making Natura Group an international player in the cosmetics industry, following in the footsteps of our previous acquisition of Aesop in 2013,” said João Paulo Ferreira, Natura’s chief executive on the matter.
The Body Shop has struggled with sales over the last couple of years, as it faced increasing competition from other brands offering similar products based on natural ingredients with no animal testing.

Tesco has launched a one-hour grocery delivery service for customers in central London in a clear attempt to take on Amazon and its ‘Prime Now’ offering.
The app-based service, called Tesco Now, is priced at £7.99 with no minimum spend on an order. Customers can choose from a range of 1,000 products, including fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy and meat products as well as beauty and baby options, via the app. Orders are sourced through local stores and delivered via moped using Quiqup, a London-based delivery startup. The service is only available in a select few central London postcodes.
Adrian Letts, online managing director at Tesco, says: “From forgotten essentials to that crucial final ingredient, Tesco Now can get them to our customers’ door within the hour. Shoppers’ needs are changing and we want to offer a range of services that allow them to shop with us in a way that suits their needs. We look forward to hearing what they think of the new service.”
Nestlé is under pressure from activist investor Dan Loeb to slim down its business and return more value to shareholders. His hedge fund, Third Point, has amassed a $3.5bn stake in Nestlé and is now agitating for change.
In a letter to investors, Loeb claims Nestlé’s shares have underperformed “despite it having arguably the best-positioned portfolio” in FMCG. “It is rare to find a business of Nestlé’s quality with so many avenues for improvement,” he adds, calling on Nestlé to raise profitability, and sell non-core assets including its 23% stake in L’Oréal.
Nestlé has not directly commented, saying just that it “remains committed to executing our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value”.

Google is likely to be issued with a record fine from EU antitrust regulators over its shopping service, with a decision expected as soon as today (27 June), according to Reuters.
The case was triggered by a number of complaints from rivals in both the US and Europe that Google was favouring its own shopping service in search results. Google says it believes its innovations in online shopping have been “good for shoppers, retailers and competition”.
Companies found in breach of antitrust laws can be fined up to 10% of global turnover, but a $1bn is thought to be more likely. Intel received the largest ever fine to date of €1.06 in 2009.

Debenhams third-quarter results were hit by “volatile” trading as sales fell amid difficult conditions on the UK high street. Like-for-like sales across the group fell by 0.9% year on year, while gross transaction value was down 1% in the 15 weeks to 17 June. However, digital provided a high spot with sales growth of 7.9%.
Debenhams stopped just short of issuing a profit warning, saying it still expects profits to hit targets, but warning that “if market volatility continues” they could come in at the lower end of its range. And it says its new strategy, focused on making the brand a destination for ‘social shopping’ will improve the customer experience and simplify and focus its operations.
“As industry data has confirmed, May was a tough month for retailers and we continue to see volatility in trading week to week. As a result we are focused on delivering cost control and self-help through our “Fix the Basics” plan. We continue to build good foundations for longer term growth at Debenhams by becoming a Destination, Digital and Different,” says CEO Sergio Bucher.
Tommy Hilfiger has created a chatbot that sits within its video ads as it looks to extend the reach of AI beyond Facebook Messenger. The bot is accessed via a call-to-action laid over the video creative encouraging users to engage. That call-to-action is based on the time of day, for example it could say ‘Good morning – chat to us’.
The chatbot, developed with msg.ai and Teads, lets consumers explore pieces from the brand’s new collection by asking questions to help identify their tastes. If a user wants to buy, the can be transferred to tommy.com where the items will already be in their basket.
Marketing Week is holding an event next week all about artificial intelligence and chatbots. To find out more and book tickets vist www.marketingweek.com/supercharged/
A new Snapchat feature that reveals users’ locations has been raised as a concern by police who fear it could encourage stalking and put vulnerable people at risk.
The feature uses the smartphone’s GPS sensor to show users where their friends are but police forces have warned parents to disable the ‘Snap Maps’ feature on their children’s phones in order to protect them.

Facebook is eyeing a move into scripted TV-style content after having talks with Hollywood studios, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. It could launch original programming by late summer.
The social network has reportedly agreed to production budgets of $3m per episode, with sources suggest it is hoping to target audiences aged 13 to 34, with a focus on the 17 to 30 range.
Faacebook has apparently already lined up relationship drama ‘Strangers’ and a game show called ‘Last State Standing’.

Health food retailer Holland & Barrett has been sold to Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s investment fund L1 Retail for £1.8bn.
The chain, which was sold by private equity owners Carlyle Group, has 1,150 stores with more than half of those in the UK. It also operates in China, India, the Netherlands and the UAE.
The sale allows Carlyle Group to make a partial exit from Holland & Barrett owner Nature’s Bounty, which it acquired seven years ago for $3.8bn. It had hoped to sell off the entire business, which also makes and distributes brands including Sundown Naturals, Pure Protein and MET-Rx.

Sex doesn’t sell, according to a new study, which shows provocative ad campaigns have little impact on sales and could even negatively effect a brand’s reputation.
The study by the University of Illinois looks at the effect sex in advertising has on memory, attitude, and purchase intentions based on the analysis of 78 studies from the past three decades.
While people may be inclined to remember the ad, it finds people are no more likely to recall a brand’s name or buy a product if an ad contains sexualised content.
The report’s author, advertising professor at John Wirtz, says: “We found that people remember ads with sexual appeals more than those without. But that effect doesn’t extend to the brands or products that are featured in the ads. We found literally zero effect on participants’ intention to buy products in ads with a sexual appeal.”

Dixons Carphone, which owns Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse, is expected to report profits of over £490m in the year to the end of April, up from £447m the previous year.
The forecast comes after overall high street sales fell 1.3% in May compared to the same month in 2016.
Dixons Carphone ended its joint venture with US mobile network Sprint after less than two years – the latest forecast does not account for the associated losses. The retailer reports its full-year profits on Wednesday (28 June)

In 2016 Marketing Week explored the true meaning of ‘digital transformation’. One year on we look at how brands are tackling the challenges and what the new priorities are.
Having worked at Tesco for over 10 years as a supply chain director, Bruno Monteyne is now one of the UK’s most respected retail analysts. He tells Marketing Week why marketing, which he describes as a “critical” business function, needs to become more clearly defined.
After redefining its core purpose as a platform for news Twitter is trying to change perceptions and attract new users by leading with a brand-level message for the first time.
The razor subscription service explains how it is keeping its ‘disruptive’ tone of voice after being bought by Unilever last year.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

Amazon, Argos, Aviva, Brewdog, Cancer Research UK, Just Eat, Maltesers, McDonald’s, Tesco and Yorkshire Tea will battle it out to be crowned The Masters of Marketing Awards’ Brand of the Year.
Voting is now open for the Brand of the Year in the 2017 Marketing Week Masters of Marketing Awards.
Up for the award this year are Amazon, Argos, Aviva, Brewdog, Cancer Research UK, Just Eat, Maltesers, McDonald’s, Tesco and Yorkshire Tea. Each one has a unique reason why it has made the shortlist, and you can read more about each individual brand below.
The Brand of the Year will be chosen by a combination of your votes and the thoughts of our stellar panel of judges.
To vote, visit the dedicated page at www.festivalofmarketing.com/awards/brand-of-the-year
And if you are unsure which brand to vote for, here are some of the reasons they are on the shortlist:
Amazon has used the past year to stake out new business models in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things. September 2016 saw the UK launch of Echo, its voice-activated home assistant, powered by its Alexa AI, a potentially game-changing product that Amazon has put all its marketing weight behind in 2017.
The brand has also revealed sales figures for its Prime membership service for the first time, earning over £5bn in revenues in 2016. Prime sales grew 43% in the year as Amazon quadrupled its overall profits.
Always one to surprise, Amazon has also made a $13.7bn offer for Whole Foods as it looks to become a serious player in the grocery market.
It is also unlikely to cease its production line of innovations, which have recently included Amazon Fresh grocery deliveries and the Dash button, as well as the launch of Prime Wardrobe.
It’s been an eventful year for Argos following its $1.4bn acquisition by Sainsbury’s in 2016. But new ownership hasn’t slowed down its ambitious growth agenda, if anything it has accelerated it. There are now around 50 concessions in Sainsbury’s stores and for the 10 that have been open for more than a year, sales are up by double-digit figures year on year, while at those open for six months sales are between 15% and 20% ahead of expectations, according to the business.
Following a successful Christmas campaign, Argos was also credited with carrying Sainsbury’s over the festive period with like-for-like sales up 4%.
In April, Argos claimed a world first with the launch of a campaign that saw it run 80 time-stamped TV ads across 100 days.
Almost 10 years on from its rebrand from Norwich Union, Aviva is a fixture and force in the financial services market.
Unusual for a company in its sector, marketing is central to its success. Explaining his theory for corporate success earlier this year, Aviva’s UK CEO Andy Briggs told Marketing Week that marketing would be leading corporate success. “Businesses will win if they understand what is important to their customers [and] develop really strong propositions that meet those customer needs.”
Aviva is also leading the way in its commitment to diversity and inclusion. Global brand director Jan Gooding was named its first global inclusion director this year.
BrewDog has come a long way from its beginnings 10 years ago as the agent provocateur and bête noire of the established beer industry, when it made its name as much for publicity stunts as for its products. But with the craft beer revolution becoming a mainstream phenomenon, it is now one of the industry’s power brands.
The business is now valued at almost £1bn, after selling a 22% stake to San Francisco private equity fund TSG Consumer Partners.
BrewDog moved into yet another new area in late 2016, launching its first spirits brand – Lone Wolf gin and vodka. Over the year, it also grew its UK sales by 97%, with its Punk IPA beer growing by 130% and Dead Pony Club by nearly 160%.
In the last 12 months, Cancer Research UK has demonstrated the kind of innovation and ambition in its marketing that belies its charitable status and its relatively modest budget.
It launched ‘Sprintathon’ in September, an attempt in partnership with Channel 4 to breathe new life into marathon fundraising that saw 422 runners perform consecutive 100-metre sprints. It followed it in October with a 12-hour Stand Up To Cancer telethon, which was live-streamed on YouTube and handed vloggers and influencers control over fundraising efforts. Its year of doing things differently culminated in the airing of the first ever live colonoscopy during an ad break on Channel 4.
Moves are underpinned by a desire to move away from “generic” fundraising efforts.
Just Eat enjoyed a stellar 2016, with revenue rising by 52% and profit more than doubling to £91m .
The “marketing and technology” company invests heavily in customer experience with a big focus on tech innovation such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and robotics to improve service in the face of increasing competition from the likes of Uber and Deliveroo.
It also invested time, money and effort in building its brand with a new logo and uniform for delivery staff and in expanding its “community” of restaurants.
After winning Channel 4’s competition for £1m-worth of commercial airtime during the 2016 Paralympics, Mars-owned Maltesers has built differentiation into its brand by continuing to put inclusivity at the heart of its positioning.
Thanks to its Paralympics campaign, which sought to highlight the place of disability in society, sales were growing at 10% at the end of 2016. After the best results in eight years, Mars vice-president of marketing Michele Oliver told Marketing Week to expect diversity “in everything coming from the brand from now on”.
Maltesers followed up the activity in January 2017 with outdoor ads written in Braille.
McDonald’s in the UK finished 2016 posting its 43rd consecutive quarter of growth. In a market that has seen pressure from government and public health campaigners, as well as a host of new entrants, the brand’s local achievements are notable. This especially the case when you consider McDonald’s in the US reported a sales drop in the final quarter.
A renewed focus on the customer, demonstrated by the ‘Experience of the future’ programme that will see all its UK restaurants get a hi-tech make-over including table service and digital self-service kiosks, is cited among the drivers of its success. And it is now looking to move into food delivery in the UK through a tie-up with UberEATS.
Tesco has made huge strides over the past year to repair the damage caused by the 2014 accounting scandal, which saw consumer confidence in the brand nosedive. With former marketer Dave Lewis at the helm, the UK’s largest supermarket has put customers first and foremost, helping its UK stores return to sales growth.
With chief customer officer Alessandra Bellini coming on board in March to head up marketing the brand has taken a new direction, implementing an “inside out” approach to marketing that sees it take inspiration from shop floor colleagues in order to get closer to customers.
Healthy living has remained high on the agenda with a series of initiatives to encourage people to make healthier choices and a tie up with the British Heart Foundation. The supermarket giant has also gone one step further by taking 8,000 tonnes of sugar, fat and salt out of its supply chain.
In a declining market where consumers are turning their backs on black tea in favour of coffee and speciality teas, the Yorkshire Tea brand has shown some of the famed stoicism of the county it originates from.
Employing some of Yorkshire’s best known sons and daughters including TV veteran Michael Parkinson, Olympic triathletes the Brownlee brothers and the Kaiser Chiefs in recent advertising campaigns, the brand is punching above its weight.
The brand was the only FMCG brand to be listed in the top 10 in YouGov’s BrandIndex’s 2016 ranking of the most favourably perceived brands in the UK.

‘Mark Ritson Award for Marketing Excellence’ will be his pick of The Masters of Marketing’s channel and sector category award winners.
The Festival of Marketing will bring together two of the titans of the marketing industry to debate the impact of Sharp’s best-selling book ‘How Brands Grow’.
Digital metrics are a mess of confusion and obfuscation, but it’s clear most marketers have bought into this opaque and over-complicated world.
Increasing dwell time is not the platform’s goal, according to president Tim Kendall, who instead wants to help people achieve their objective with the “least amount of friction”.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

The event, taking place on 4 July in London, will look to explore the link between marketers and machines and how to maximise results.
We are bringing big brands including Asos, Just Eat and Shop Direct together to talk about artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots and how marketers can work with machines at our new event, Supercharged.
Taking place at etc.venues County Hall in London on 4 July, the one-day conference aims to help marketers uncover the world of AI-powered marketing and how to pair marketers and machines for maximum results.
The day includes Just Eat UK marketing director Ben Carter exploring the event between chatbots and marketing, while Asos’ Ben Chamberlain will discuss whether AI can provide a silver bullet for tools such as personalisation, loyalty and trust. We will also be joined by IBM evangelist Jeremy Waite who will use its AI tech Watson to provoke discussion on what the world’s best marketer really looks like.
In-keeping with the theme of the event, our sister brand Econsultancy has also created a chatbot that allows people to find out more about Supercharged, while experiencing AI in action. To give it a go head to just start chatting to Econsultancy on Facebook Messenger or click this link click this link.
To find out more details, including how to book tickets, head to the event website www.marketingweek.com/supercharged
From training staff to driving one-on-one brand engagement, Adidas, Just Eat and HTC are using chatbots in very different ways, but each is learning rapidly about the opportunities they could offer.
The internet giant claims its “cutting edge” machine learning work will help advertisers better understand the consumer journey and therefore how their marketing leads to a sale.
Should marketers fear for their jobs or embrace the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, so they can adapt now and stay relevant in the future?

Unwilling to be typecast by any one role, marketers are orchestrating strategic career rebrands that not only grow their skillset, but add real value to the business.
Marketers across every sector are rebranding their careers by transferring their rich knowledge and unique skills into new roles that often break the mould.
A great example is Sherine Yap, who describes herself as a new breed of marketer. Following a string of roles both on agency side and as a brand marketer, Yap was appointed global head of CRM at oil giant Shell in January 2015.
She explains how the organisation “took a chance” on her, asking her to bring the customer centricity and commerciality of her brand marketing roots into the world of data. It was Yap’s rich experience in other areas of marketing that made the career rebrand possible.
“What I bring into the role is commerciality. I understand the customer and I understand the commercial aspects, and my big tip if you want to get your messages up to the C-Suite is you need to speak the language of finance and business,” she explains.
Helen Tupper, a marketing director at Microsoft and co-founder of career development and training business Amazing If, recognises the choice being faced by marketers about whether to take a vertical or horizontal career path.
“You could progress your career vertically taking one discipline, like brand marketing and going for it. And you could be very good at that, but you’ll probably tap out in your organisation, because to keep learning you’re probably going to need to go elsewhere,” she says.
“Or you might want to be more of a horizontal marketer who has a few more strings to their bow.”
Always having customer and commercial at my heart has taught me to trust my instincts.
Tupper’s own CV spans a diverse range of roles from innovation venture manager at energy company E.ON to global head of customer experience and thought leadership at BP, and head of insight at Virgin, leading a team of data analysts.

In October, Tupper traded in her role as head of marketing at loyalty app Virgin Red for evangelism marketing director in the developer experience (DX) division at Microsoft.
As her career has transitioned from innovation and customer experience to insight and tech, Tupper has come to believe that moving into data or sales makes you more valuable both as a marketer and a future leader.
“I think if you’re a horizontal marketer you can pick a few more disciplines within marketing and can be more valuable to your organisation, because you’ve got a better understanding of the end-to-end picture of marketing. You add more value to the business and you become more valuable yourself,” she explains.
Having confidence in the unique skills you bring to a role is crucial for a career rebrand to work, especially in a fast-paced industry where marketers can find themselves taking on roles that had previously not existed.
“This is something that’s happening more and more,” says Alessandra Di Lorenzo, chief commercial officer, media and partnerships at Lastminute.com Group.
“The skills people have coming into the industry means jobs are changing so quickly. You’ve got new roles like data analyst or audience specialist, so for hiring managers to find a like-for-like match is very difficult. It means there’s an opportunity to really shine [as a marketer] from an attitude perspective and your lateral skills come into play when you’re moving around.”
An understanding of the marketing ecosystem has helped make her a more well-rounded and strategic marketer, says Di Lorenzo, for whom commerciality is a common thread running throughout her diverse career.
Since being appointed business development manager at Yahoo Mobile in 2007, Di Lorenzo has served as head of strategic partnerships EMEA at Nokia, head of mobile marketing at Vodafone and commercial director at eBay Advertising.
Now as Lastminute.com Group commercial director Di Lorenzo manages 55 people across seven locations spanning the group’s travel websites Lastminute.com (in the UK and France), Volagratis (in Italy), Rumbo (Spain) and social travel network Wayn, as well as media business Travel People.
“My role is very much a crossover between marketing and commercial, that’s why I call it commercial marketing,” she explains.
“The fact I understand thoroughly the publishing side of marketing makes my knowledge of the buy side much stronger, so when I’m buying media I know what to look out for because I’m also selling media and I’ve done it in the past. Understanding the whole ecosystem actually makes me a more powerful marketer and it does add value.”
Marketers embarking on a career rebrand often need to find ways to communicate why having skills that sit beyond the conventional skillset will help them unite teams and break down silos.
It is a marketer’s ability to “join the dots” that means they can make a difference argues Tupper, whose new role involves bridging the gap between early stage engagement and mass-market adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
“I’ve never worked in technology before and I’m heading up this team, and I have to tell myself that I don’t need to be as technical as them, because that’s not why I’ve been brought in to do the job,” Tupper explains.
“I’ve been brought in because I’m strategic, creative and visionary, and I’ve got to harness their strengths and not try to have the same strengths. You’re adding something broader and breaking down silos. You’re the one who can join the dots. That’s your value, not being the best data person.”
This opinion is shared by Shell’s Sherine Yap, who believes the very fact she does not have data “coursing through her veins” was the reason Shell wanted her to run the global CRM function.
She recalls the “massive culture shock” of joining the data team and how it encouraged her to adopt a pragmatic approach, which pushed the teams to generate timely and actionable insights with the ability to inspire real change.
To avoid the perception of being some kind of marketing job-hopper who doesn’t quite know what discipline they want to do, you have to be really clear about what your strengths and values are.
Helen Tupper, Microsoft
Based on her own diverse experience, Lastminute.com Group’s Alessandra Di Lorenzo prioritises people who can confidently demonstrate different skills and a broad knowledge of the marketing mix when hiring new talent.
“I’m looking for well rounded people, or for more junior roles, people who have the right attitude because in the world we live in we need marketers who can connect the dots, who can connect the creative marketing person with the data person, and understand how they can work together. So definitely the connected mindset is very important,” she adds.
Sometimes getting other people in the company to believe in your career move can require persistence and the ability to make a compelling business case, showing why you will be an asset to the new team.
“You might get some resistance,” Tupper acknowledges. “You might say ‘I think I’d be great in CRM’, but the organisation might say ‘you don’t have a data background’. In that case you need to help them see where the value is if you’re passionate about it for your own career.”
She advises marketers to find a leader who buys into them or discuss with HR how they could be a good model for this type of move. Tupper also believes it is important to have a “red thread” throughout your career which connects your various roles.
“The personal thing I say is I help organisations lead through the new. That’s generally why I end up in innovation departments. If businesses get what I’m about it makes sense,” Tupper explains.
“So to avoid the perception of being some kind of marketing job-hopper who doesn’t quite know what discipline they want to do, you have to be really clear about what your strengths and values are. If you’ve got a red thread that makes sense.”
The ‘red thread’ for Lysa Hardy, chief customer officer at clothing brand Joules, is her fundamental belief that marketing is about creating demand and delivering sales. This is the reason she has sought a strong commercial element to all the roles throughout her career.   
After starting out as head of leisure marketing at US travel tech company Sabre, Hardy took on roles as head of prepay marketing at Orange and T-Mobile, before being appointed vice-president of mobile internet at T-Mobile.
Positions followed as head of brand and communications at T-Mobile and interim sales and marketing director at the RAC, before she was appointed as chief commercial officer at health and wellbeing business Holland & Barrett in 2012. There Hardy integrated elements from all her previous roles to drive the business forward, for example introducing a category management approach which focused on having the right product set and trading it strongly.

However, Hardy believes her whole career has led perfectly to her current role as Joules’ chief customer officer, a position which enables her to combine test and learn commerciality with a strong belief in customer centrality.
“I’ve moved into a number of different roles where initially I haven’t always been the expert in a specific field, but always having customer and commercial at my heart has taught me to trust my instincts,” she advises.
“Whether I’m in a role that I feel very comfortable in because I’ve got lots of experience or I’m at the beginning of a role where perhaps it’s a bit new to me, I still take the same approach of constantly testing, looking at what the data is telling me, learning from that and moving on.”
Hardy acknowledges that you often need confidence to convince people you are right for the move, especially when people do not necessarily understand the evolving nature of marketing.
“I mentor quite a few people and the thing I always say to them as a marketer is that you are undoubtedly the person with the best understanding of the customer and use that to give you confidence, an angle and an edge as to what you could bring to another role,” she adds.
If people want to stay in marketing for the rest of their career, Hardy argues it is important to explore a variety of areas as they could lead into different parts of the business where a marketing background will help to make someone “outstanding”.
An interesting article. Is it a coincidence that all the examples you quote are female?
Being bought in for a particular purpose can be a huge advantage in overseeing a project.  You are not loyal to a particular team or discipline and you get a great perspective on the unique challenge. Is it good to say ‘i do this and only this, specifically’ and apply that to every project?
Marketing is changing daily and Marketeers know that. It’s no longer a good idea to specialise but diversification and flexibility will keep you relevant as long as you have a foundation of knowledge in key marketing principles.
Sorry, another female example here. I was a journalist, became an advertising copywriter, embraced digital marketing and I now build websites with CMSes. I have taught digital marketing and even co-wrote an academic paper on CRM (under peer review). I currently teach blogging and am moving into analytics and business reporting. Except that I have just sold a journalistic style article on branding for SMEs and have a book in the pipeline. This might look jumpy on the CV but I am a contractor/freelancer and you need as many skills as you can to survive in a competitive and often ageist sector.
Helen Tupper, director of careers specialist Amazing If and former head of marketing at Virgin Red, outlines the three things people should ask themselves before looking to move job.
The transition from brand marketer to global head of CRM at Shell Retail has taught Sherine Yap the value of commerciality, storytelling and being pragmatic.

Nike is to cut 2% of its global workforce, approximately 1,400 jobs, as it looks streamline its organisational structure.
The US sportswear giant is also planning to consolidate its product lines by slashing the number of styles its produces by 25%.
The changes coincide with the introduction of Nike’s “Consumer Direct Offense”, a new structure focused on using digital to drive growth amongst consumers in 12 key cities including New York, London, LA and Shanghai. Nike expects these cities to represent over 80% of its growth by 2020.
In order to serve these global cities the company has streamlined is geographical structure from six to four areas, comprised of North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Greater China and Asia Pacific and Latin America (APLA).
The company is also creating a new division, Nike Direct, which will unite Nike.com, direct-to-consumer retail and Nike+ digital products.
The changes come at a time when Nike has been outpaced by rival Adidas. During the three months to the end of February Adidas recorded its biggest US sales increase, up 31% compared to growth of just 3% at Nike. Meanwhile in China Adidas saw its sales rise 31%, double the growth registered by Nike at 15%.

Lidl has opened 10 US stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, the first stage in an aggressive North American expansion plan.
The supermarket discounter plans to open 80 new stores along the US East Coast by the middle of 2018, pitching itself as offering prices 50% lower than the domestic competition.
Lidl is following in the footsteps of discount rival Aldi, which already has over 1,600 stores across 35 states, since opening its first US store in Iowa in 1976. Aldi is on track to open 2,500 stores nationwide by 2022, making it the third largest supermarket chain in the US, while expectations are Lidl could add over 600 US stores in the next five years.

Facebook is planning to ramp up its use of artificial intelligence in a bid to combat terrorist content about ISIS, Al Qaeda and their affiliates.
Using image matching technology, Facebook systems will search to see if images being uploaded to the site match known terrorist photos or videos. This means that even if a propaganda video has been removed Facebook can prevent other accounts from uploading the same footage.
The website has also started experimenting with AI to detect text that advocates for terrorism, in order to develop text-based signals which highlight when terrorist propaganda is being posted. Facebook will also work to identify pages, groups, posts or profiles supporting terrorism, in order to break terrorist clusters. The new technology will also extend to WhatsApp and Instagram.
Facebook’s counter terrorism push comes after the site, along with Twitter and Google, came under heavy criticism from British Prime Minister Theresa May for failing to monitor and remove extremist content in the wake of the London and Manchester terrorist attacks in May and June.

Confectionary giant Nestle is rumoured to be on the brink of selling its US business.
The US arm, which includes its Butterfinger, BabyRuth, 100Grand, SkinnyCow and Raisinets brands, had previously been by Nestle as “disappointing”.
The BBC reports that the potential deal, which represents 3% of Nestle’s US sales, would exclude its Toll House bakery business.
In a statement, the company said it remained fully committed to its international business, “particularly its global brand KitKat”.

The latest ad in Tesco’s ‘Food Love Stores’ above-the-line campaign highlights its ongoing bid to reduce food waste.
The ad shows Community Food Connection, the supermarket’s surplus food redistribution scheme, in action alongside Bo’ness Academy, one of 5,000 charities that benefit from this scheme.
Bo’ness Acacdemy uses the surplus food to give school children the opportunity to learn how to cook, with their creations then given back to the local community via a café.
“‘Food Love Stories’ is all about how passion for good food can bring people together,” says Alessandra Bellini, chief customer officer at Tesco. “By the end of the year, no food fit for human consumption will go to waste from our UK stores.”

From reducing food waste to simply adding to it, KFC is set to send a Zinger burger into space.
Working with agency Wieden + Kennedy, the fastfood giant will send the burger to the edge of space thanks to a partnership with space flight experts World View.
Space remains hot among advertisers due to the success of the Red Bull Stratos marketing stunt.
Equally, we can’t help but feel like this is a waste of a perfectly good burger. Let’s hope it’s still hot by the time E.T. receives it.

Only 7% of marketers said they used Snapchat in the first quarter of 2017, according to a new survey by Statisa.
This compared to 94% of marketers using Facebook. And even the likes of Twitter (68%) and Pinterest (30%) generated more interest from the advertising community.
Since launching an IPO earlier this year, Snap’s shares haven’t quite caught fire like analysts were expecting. It has also suffered due to Instagram successfully integrating its best featurets such as Stories.

In a bid to boost transparency, Facebook is giving brands more control over where their ads will appear across its social network.
New tools will provide advertisers with a list of publishers up front to show where ads might appear via Instant Articles, in-stream ads within Facebook and across the Facebook Audience Network. Currently in beta, the tools will be rolled out over the course of this year.
Along with pre-campaign previews, the company will now also let advertisers prevent ads from appearing in undesirable places by blocking them at the account level, according to Ad Week.
The previous way of doing this meant advertisers had to list every possible publication they might not want their ads running with and every app they didn’t want it to appear in. However, they still had no way of knowing if certain websites were even within Facebook’s network or using Instant Articles.

Australian actress Rebel Wilson has won a defamation case against Bauer Media.
Wilson had taken the publisher to court after claiming it had damaged her reputation due to a series of articles published in May 2015, which suggested she had made up stories about her age, name and childhood.
She claimed they painted her as a “serial liar” and prevented her from getting work in Hollywood for a two-year period. The articles were published in Woman’s Day, OK! Magazine and New Weekly.
Bauer is expected to appeal the verdict, which will result in a sizeable payout in damages to the actress.

Uber boss Travis Kalanick plans to take time away from the company, and could return in a diminished role.
It comes after a review of management and practices at the firm, which is facing a number of scandals including complaints of sexual harassment.
Uber’s board on Sunday voted in favour of the recommendations from the review.
In the email to staff, Mr Kalanick said the decision to take leave, which also comes after the sudden death of his mother in a boating accident, is part of an effort to create “Uber 2.0”.
“For Uber 2.0 to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team,” Mr Kalanick wrote. “But if we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve.”
Mr Kalanick’s email did not say how long he would be away from the firm.

Netflix and Amazon are set to overtake the cinema multiplex after a report predicted that revenues from streaming film and TV shows in the UK will exceed box office takings by 2020.
Paying for TV content from on-demand digital video services will grow by more than 30% to £1.42bn at the turn of the decade, claims consultancy firm PwC. This rise in popularity will see revenue from video services edge ahead of an estimated £1.41bn from cinemagoers.
“Demand for internet video shows no signs of slowing down,” said Phil Stokes, UK head of entertainment and media at PwC. However, he warned against forecasting the death of blockbusters or the big screens where they are shown.
“Look at the box office performance of films such as Star Wars: Rogue One or Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them to see the significant amount of enthusiasm for blockbuster movies out there.”

Google has created a free, interactive, browser based game, Interland as part of its ‘Be Internet Awesome’ programme that looks to teach children how to be safe and responsible online.
The project, created in partnership with digital experience design company North Kingdom, is browser based and designed with accessibility in mind, making it playable on desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile phone.
The game allows the user to “fend off hackers” and “one-up cyberbullies” while learning what they can do keep their accounts from being broken into.
Apple said on Tuesday that it is raising $1bn in debt in a ‘green bond’ that will be used to fund environmentally focused initiatives.
The bond sale comes after US President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate pact, a move that ignited condemnation from a wide variety of business and political leaders.
Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said at the time that he had tried to “persuade” Mr Trump not to leave the agreement, but that it “wasn’t enough”.
“I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment,” he said in a memo to Apple staff.

British households are under pressure as inflation picked up again to hit 2.9% last month, its highest rate in four years. This is due to the weak pound pushing up the price of imports.
That is an increase from 2.7% in the 12 months to April, and means prices are soaring even as wage growth slows down – regular pay is only thought to have risen by 2% in the year to April.
Food, clothing and toys costs all pushed up the annual rate, as every major category of goods measured by the Office for National Statistics showed rising prices, except for transport costs. Even the fall in fuel costs is likely to be reversed as prices have edged up again in June.

It has been another dramatic 24 hours for Uber with further changes to its managerial structure before its Holder report is released today.
Its chief executive Travis Kalanick will present employees with the findings of the report about Uber’s culture, despite the fact it was announced yesterday he would be taking leave of absence.
The report is the result of an investigation into the bad habits that developed as Uber grew from a start-up to a tech giant. These include sexual harassment charges, a backlash over is political stance and a number of fires and hires.
It was also announced that Emil Michael, senior vice-president at Uber, was leaving the company yesterday.

Pinterest is changing its employee benefits to help ease the path to parenthood. From 1 July, all Pinterest employees will have access to up to $5,000 in net benefits toward adoption and up to $20,000 toward surrogacy. These benefits will cover everything from travelling to agency and legal fees and other related expenses.

Facebook is planning an expansion of its Groups feature that will put online communities at the centre of the social network.
The tech giant is testing a Groups section in its smartphone app that will see it appear alongside the main notifications, friends requests and news feed areas.
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, believes the groups feature will help make Facebook a destination for “meaningful” online connections, rather than the frivolous interactions with which many associate social media.
“This is a test to help people more easily navigate Facebook and find what is interesting to them,” a Facebook spokesman tells the Telegraph.

Aldi has unveiled its summer campaign featuring Team GB brothers Alistair and Jonny Brownlee displaying their competitive spirit in a series of shopping challenges.
The brothers, who won gold and silver in the mens triathlon at the Rio Olympics, are seen trying to beat the other on price – one shopping in Aldi and the other at one of the big four supermarkets. The winner of each round is then shown cooking a BBQ or preparing a picnic while the losing brother is forced to do a forfeit.
Adam Zavalis, marketing director at Aldi, says: “This campaign taps into the unrivalled competitiveness of the Brownlee brothers delivered via our distinctive humour to showcase why choosing Aldi this summer will get you to the top of the podium with our award-winning quality at unbeatable prices.”
The ads look to reinforce Aldi’s Team GB ‘Get Set to Eat Fresh’ commitment through which the brand aims to educate 1.2 million children about the benefits of healthy eating.
Aldi became the first UK supermarket to sponsor Team GB in 2015 through which it has pushed its healthy eating message and a focus on fresh British produce.
As part of the campaign Aldi was the official supermarket partner of the Leeds World Series Triathlon yesterday (11 June), which last year saw the Brownlees take home first and second place.
It unveiled its outdoor campaign at the event which mirrors the style of an ad Manchester City ran in 2009 featuring footballer Carlos Tevez. The ad shows a picture of the Brownlee brothers with the caption ‘Welcome to Yorkshire’s finest’ which the brand says is a “cheeky” dig at its competitors Morrisons and Asda which are based in the region.
Jaguar Land Rover has invested $25m in ride-hailing business Lyft, a rival of Uber.
As part of the deal JLR will also provide a fleet of Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, as well as working with the firm on autonomous vehicle testing.
The automotive firm’s venture capital subsidiary, InMotion Ventures, made the investment as part of a $600m fundraising push that values Lyft at $7.5bn.

Uber has taken on all recommendations following an investigation it commissioned into allegations of sexual harassment at the company.
It has yet to be confirmed whether CEO Travis Kalanick and head of business Emil Michael will be asked to take a leave of absence.
The investigation, led by former US Attorney General Eric Holder, culminated in a meeting yesterday. Uber will begin implementing the outlined changes this week and share them with employees at a meeting on Tuesday.

UK households have cut back spending for the first time since 2013 against a backdrop of political uncertainty and rising prices.
The data from credit and debit card processing business Visa shows a drop in spending across a range of categories last month, including clothing, food, transport and household goods.
Economists have expressed concern that the inconclusive result of last week’s general election will only create more uncertainty among consumers and businesses.

Startups are taking the strain off the NHS and other healthcare providers by implementing efficiencies across the healthcare system with the help of smart technology and rich data.
Giving consumers control back over their health is the mission of a new wave of startups, who are using smart technology to disrupt the healthcare industry and drive better health.
While helping consumers is the central goal, the disruptors are also working to free up time for doctors and implement efficiencies across the healthcare system.
A notable example is New York-based AdhereTech, one of the healthcare brands chosen as one of Marketing Week’s 100 Disruptive Brands 2017. Founded in 2011, AdhereTech partners with large pharmaceutical companies who sponsor programmes for patients, usually those suffering from cancer, to receive their medicine in a smart bottle.
While it looks just like a normal medicine bottle, the AdhereTech bottle contains a number of sensors which feed data into the company’s system 24-hours a day. By comparing the patient’s actual behaviour to their prescribed dosage, AdhereTech programmes the bottle to flash, play a song or send automated phone calls or texts if the sensors detect that the patient has made a mistake with their medication.
As well as helping the patient stay healthy, the smart bottles ensure users take their prescribed medication and therefore do not put additional strain to the healthcare system by their condition getting worse.
“Adherence is literally one of the biggest problems in healthcare, arguably the biggest, and in the US $300bn in increased costs are attributed to patients not taking their medication as prescribed,” explains Josh Stein, CEO and co-founder of AdhereTech.
The idea is to take things out of a doctor’s workload that could be done better by machine
Stein believes this kind of smart tech has a huge potential to change lives in the healthcare space, especially if patients consider the level of analysis that goes into every other aspect of their lives.
“If you drive a new car there are all these sensors making sure everything operates correctly. There is nothing like that for the human body, but there should be because it’s a lot more important,” he argues.
“It is also important that the product evolves to meet the needs of your users. If you look across different sectors beyond healthcare, the reason why new companies can capture a large percentage of the market is because they know what users want. And if you want to build a tool patients will actually use you have to fit into their life.”
This opinion is shared by Richard Guest, CMO of fellow healthcare disruptor Babylon Health, who argues that as society faces an ageing population with chronic health conditions, we need need to get significantly better at preventing health issues.
Aiming to connect patients to doctors in a fast and seamless way, Babylon offers a variety of services including a health advice chatbot, GP video chat function, prescription delivery service and health tracker.
Over the past year the company has beefed up its data science and engineering team in order to tap into the opportunities of artificial intelligence. Guest believes Babylon’s on-demand services will save doctors time and thereby free them up to have more in-depth conversations with patients.
“The idea is to take things out of a doctor’s workload that could be done better by machine, thereby allowing them to talk to their patients and spend time in that interaction,” Guest explains.
“Once you get into the predictive space you can help people stay fitter for longer, so it’s really disruptive innovation waiting to happen.”
In the wake of the recent malware attack on NHS operating systems in England and Scotland, which saw operations cancelled and services come to a standstill, it is clearer than ever that healthcare data is precious and should be treated with respect.
This is the philosophy at Thriva, which is founded on the principle that customers own their own data and therefore any personal information must be stored with a high degree of integrity.
Thriva aims to simplify the blood test process by sending patients a finger-prick blood test kit they can use at home. The blood sample is then analysed by one of Thriva’s NHS certified labs and the results reviewed by a qualified GP, who creates a bespoke report for the patient.
If you drive a new car there are all these sensors making sure everything operates correctly. There is nothing like that for the human body.
The context and insight into data offered by the doctors is another crucial element of the way Thriva approaches data, explains co-founder and CEO Hamish Grierson.
“The big thing when we think about data is that in isolation it’s pretty meaningless. It needs to have an intuitive context, so its about how you use it to enrich an experience for a consumer. We’ve only just started down that path, but ultimately we want to use our data to provide insightful analytics to help users meaningfully connect their day-to-day actions with their results,” he adds.

German startup Xbird has a similar interest in using data insights to improve long-term patient health. Founded in 2015 by an inter-disciplinary team of mobile data experts and doctors, Xbird is hoping to save one million lives by 2020 using data captured via smartphones to monitor behaviour on a day-to-day basis.
Once the Xbird algorithm is installed on a phone it plugs into motion sensors so precise they can detect whether the user is walking, cycling or running. Known as continuous activity monitoring (CAM), Xbird enables the user to build an automatic passive activity diary using their monitor sensor data. This data becomes even more precise when applied to wearable tech.
The automatic collection of activity data is, for example, helping diabetics adjust their insulin dosage and then use the data to have more relevant conversations with their doctor.
“Early detection is the key to saving lives,” explains Xbird chief medical officer Jonas Harder. “In many cases when you go to the doctor it’s already too late. So the idea is to correlate the data of huge cohorts of people and use machine learning to detect specific behaviour patterns that lead to specific health events.”
Using artificial intelligence to analyse vast amounts of scientific data is helping speed up the pace of scientific discovery.
London-based Benevolent AI uses deep learning linguistic models and algorithms to analyse huge volumes of unstructured and structured data from textbooks, scientific literature and clinical trial information. The AI system translates what it has learnt into unique hypotheses, which are then tested by scientists.
Since it was founded in 2013, Benevolent AI’s system has already validated 22 hypotheses which are being applied to the development of drugs for Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).
Benevolent AI vice-president of corporate affairs, James Chandler, believes that the next five years will see more transformation in healthcare than the previous 50.
“Much of that transformation will come from technology that will be AI driven – everything from dramatically faster drug development, democratised healthcare, monitoring, diagnosis, advice and personalised medicine, to more sophisticated mobile health, remote clinical consultation and better, closer and more effective patient and machine interaction,” he explains.
However, despite the potential for AI and other emerging technologies, Chandler believes healthcare disruptors must avoid the hype and concentrate on accurately communicating what they are doing in order not to let patients down.
“In healthcare you are dealing with people, and in our case patients, who are waiting for drugs to be discovered for their particular condition, so we have a responsibility not to over promise,” says Chandler.
“Equally, we have to make sure we create awareness that we are pushing boundaries of what is technologically and scientifically possible so that patients have hope and know there is ambition to find a cure.”
By combining rich data and insight with artificial intelligence, these disruptors are not only improving the lives of patients, but saving time for strained healthcare providers like the NHS so they can focus on driving better health.

Treating patients like demanding consumers in order to deliver the seamless, trustworthy experiences they crave is helping a new wave of healthcare disruptors set themselves apart.
From ordering a taxi to having your favourite meal delivered direct to your door, consumers have come to expect slick service in every aspect of their lives. Every aspect, that is, except healthcare.
Whether it is waiting two weeks for a doctor’s appointment or struggling to organise a repeat prescription, the healthcare experience in 2017 can feel like stepping back in time.
That is until now. As Marketing Week’s 100 Disruptive Brands 2017 list shows, health is a fertile ground for innovation. Sensing the need among consumers to break down the barriers in healthcare and make the experience customer-centric, a new set of disruptors have emerged with a mission to help people take control of their health.
Brands such as Babylon, which uses chatbots to give patients an almost instant diagnosis, and Echo, which cuts down waiting time for repeat prescriptions by delivering to your door, are shaking up healthcare and shifting the power back to consumers.

Another business is Thriva, which offers individuals a finger-prick blood test kit they can administer at home to check their health. Once complete, the blood test is sent for analysis to one of Thriva’s NHS-certified labs. The results are then reviewed by a qualified GP, who creates a bespoke report for the patient to view via an online dashboard.
Consumers can subscribe to be tested every three months or opt for a one-off test analysing their thyroid or liver function, vitamin D and B12 levels, cholesterol or testosterone.
Hamish Grierson, co-founder and CEO of Thriva – one of Marketing Week’s 100 Disruptive Brands for 2017, alongside Babylon and Echo – explains that the founding principle behind it is a desire to stop people living in ignorance about what is going on inside their bodies. He argues that while the NHS is an amazing “sick care system”, it is “incapable” of delivering proactive, preventative medicine.
Timing also played a big part in the birth of Thriva in early 2016. Grierson noticed consumers starting to abandon the “outdated perspective” that their internal health has to stay invisible.
“We have got to a sufficiently evolved point of time where people are very much engaged with their health. If you look at the wearable trend, people are increasingly interested in what’s really going on with their bodies,” says Grierson.
“So it’s all about giving people control and empowering them, ultimately to ensure they make good on the truism that prevention is better than cure.”
Thriva’s customer-centric design is intended to reflect the apps and services consumers interact with on a daily basis, offering a frictionless service that can keep pace with daily life in 2017.
“Part of the reason that people have become so expecting of highly friction-free, customer-centric product experiences is because they are so busy and demand instant gratification,” says Grierson.
“When you think about any engagement, when it comes to health for the most part it is the antithesis of that. One of the goals for our company is to hold on to the very highest accessibility and friction-free standards you have come to expect from any product developed today.”
For a service to be relatable, especially in a sector as complex as healthcare, a brand cannot assume everyone has a degree in biomedical sciences, says Grierson, who believes being hyper-intuitive is the only way forward.
“It’s absolutely essential that every corner of the product experience, the way results are delivered and what actions people need to take are rooted in customer-centricity. You have to be super simple, but also recognise that people aren’t stupid. They are hungry to understand this stuff, so it’s about making it accessible and intuitive,” he adds.
The same customer-centric approach is in place at Echo. Designed to help consumers take control of their NHS repeat prescriptions, the free app allows users to scan the barcode of their medication and enter the name of their GP, after which Echo arranges to send the prescription to their door free of charge, taking a percentage of the prescription fee while boosting the pharmacy’s volume of orders.
Co-founder Stephen Bourke describes Echo as adopting a “Deliveroo-style” model, working with 10 pharmacies across London and the South East to dispense medication. Key to making the service work is the recognition that people who take repeat prescriptions do not necessarily identify as patients and therefore healthcare businesses should recognise them as consumers first and foremost.
“The whole notion of being a patient is quite depressing, so we wanted to build something that was very consumer-orientated, something akin to the best apps out there, but related to healthcare,” explains Bourke
Echo has taken inspiration from healthcare pioneers that really understand “why they exist”, such as online booking service Zesty, as well as the way behavioural psychology is applied by companies in the gaming sector like King, the developer of Candy Crush. These insights have been applied to every aspect of the service, even the packaging in which the prescriptions are delivered.
“If you give people something beautifully designed, our belief is people respond to that in a different way, they treat it differently and value it,” claims Bourke.
“For our packaging we use really nice crepe paper and stickers. We try to package the medication as you would get a delivery from Net-A-Porter. We try to have an aspect of surprise and delight, because we want [the user] to value the medication they’re getting. Our belief is if you value it, you will treat it differently and actually take it.”
A deep understanding of what consumers want is central to the service at Babylon, according to CMO Richard Guest, who took lessons from his former career as commercial director at Virgin Media into the startup environment.
Launched in 2014, Babylon aims to connect patients to doctors in a fast and seamless way through a range of services including a health advice chatbot, GP video chat function, prescription delivery service and health tracker. The idea is to cater for patients in a 24/7 on-demand world where the traditional doctor-patient relationship no longer works.
Combining mobile tech with artificial intelligence (AI), the chatbot invites users to type in their symptoms and Babylon’s algorithm then interprets their colloquial language to rule in or out conditions in the fewest possible steps.
To drive this exploration of AI technology, Babylon has grown its team from 40 people at the start of 2016 to 150 people today and is currently available in the UK and Rwanda. Seventy per cent of employees in both locations are data scientists and engineers, who work alongside doctors to help build the AI.
Utilising sophisticated technology to give consumers back control over their health is having a big impact, says Guest.
“As soon as you put the control back in people’s hands it’s fantastic. Our average waiting time for an appointment is 40 minutes and you just don’t get that [with the traditional service]. The consumer adoption has been enormous. We have had over a million downloads so far and 800,000 registrations. When we launched in Rwanda, 10% of the population registered in the first six months,” he adds.
The service is also freely available to 220,000 employees at a variety of companies including Bupa, Aviva, Sky and Talk Talk, who have signed up their teams to receive free GP video consultations, saving time that would otherwise have been lost visiting a doctor.
The overriding aim of the company is to make life easier for consumers by using technology centred on human engagement, Guest explains.
“There’s the unlimited power of technology to help us get there, but what we can’t lose is the human face and at the end of the day people do want to interact with humans. So we need to make the technology help that interaction, make it slicker and faster so you can spend more time doing what you want to do rather than filling in forms.”
The desire to humanise the experience for patients and carers came from a highly personal place for Devika Wood, co-founder and chief medical officer at social care startup Vida.
An informal carer from the age of 10, Wood watched her grandmother Sita’s struggle with dementia and epilepsy become compounded by sub-standard treatment from social care services, resulting in Sita being visited by more than 150 carers in 12 years.
“That kind of experience stays with you forever,” says Wood, who explains how her grandmother’s harrowing experience gave her an overwhelming desire to improve the social care system from the inside out.
Having worked as a cancer research scientist and health consultant, Wood met her Vida co-founder Naushard Jabir at investment firm Hambro Perks in February 2016 and within two weeks the pair had incorporated the company. Vida began trading as a standard care provider, experimenting with off-the-shelf technologies in order to experience all the pain points before building its own.
Wood hired a tech team to develop a bespoke back-end system, which matches patients with carers who meet their needs for everything from respite care to palliative care. By applying its own matching algorithm Vida has cut the time it takes to match carers and patients from two to three hours – the industry standard – to two minutes.
Speed is of the essence as far as Wood is concerned. “We’re beyond a crisis point in the healthcare system and I think instead of people wanting to take control of their health, it’s like we now need to come up with new solutions for people to take care and control of their health,” she explains.
“With community care and social care, if you put in 1% improvement it would have a massive effect on the NHS and primary care because you’re improving that person’s life in the community so they are utilising those services much less frequently.”
Over the next couple of years Vida plans to franchise out its technology to more than 8,500 agencies across the UK in order to improve the standard of care being delivered.
The company has raised £1.6m in investment since launching in 2016, growing its team to 23 people across offices in London and Brighton. The company has also embarked on reshaping the way carers are trained by implementing three-month refresher courses that enable career progression.
With regard to marketing the Vida service, Wood has learnt to forget the fads and focus on simplicity in order to build a trustworthy brand.
“Caring is a very emotional thing and it’s all about building up a brand that people can relate to and put trust in,” she explains.
“So instead of marketing the product and service, it was about building a story behind our brand, who we are and why we’re doing what we’re doing in order to get people to trust in us and that in itself enables scalability.”
An ability to recognise the problem at hand and then have the confidence to disrupt the status quo characterises disruptors in the healthcare sector.
Thriva’s Grierson believes that healthcare startups in particular have had the foresight to realise that just because institutions have been operating for a long time does not mean people enjoy the service or that it cannot be significantly improved. However, making a change means embracing hard work.
“If you look at some of the sectors that are being disrupted right now, fintech in particular, it is pretty damn difficult. It’s not just like building another widget,” Grierson acknowledges. “The reality is that if you’re prepared to take on something challenging, it’s immensely rewarding and you can solve real problems.”
For Echo’s Bourke, it is important for startups to be their own harshest critic regarding the product, service and design. To know exactly how to change the service it is also crucial to truly understand the problem you are trying to solve.
“The guiding principle of our business is whenever we have to make a decision we come back to the point: what do we want to do in order for this to be awesome? You have to make thousands of decisions a week as a startup, so being able to know the problem intimately has been a huge benefit for us,” Bourke adds.
Approaching healthcare in the same way as building an on-demand app or crafting a bespoke customer journey is enabling these startups to use emerging technology to deliver seamless experiences that give consumers the control back over their health.

Founded in 2013, ZhongAn has rapidly shaken up the insurance market in China, with radically unusual policies targeted at younger consumers.
One such policy covered people for self-inflicted alcohol poisoning if they got drunk while watching football during the 2014 World Cup. Another pays out for delayed flights while customers are still in the airport, sending them electronic vouchers so they can occupy their time by shopping.
The online-only brand, founded by Alibaba’s executive chairman Jack Ma, Tencent’s chairman Pony Ma and Ping An Insurance, already has over half a billion customers holding more than seven billion policies and is likely to opt for an initial public offering in mainland China this year.
In November 2016, ZhongAn launched its own internal incubator focusing on an ‘ABCD’ strategy of artificial intelligence, Blockchain, cloud computing, and data, aiming to develop new technologies for itself and its partners.

Berlin-based mobile healthcare startup xbird is using some of the most advanced data science and machine learning techniques.
The brand uses artificial intelligence to help prevent diseases or diagnose them early using data captured from sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes built into smartphones and wearable devices.
Much of xbird’s work so far has been with diabetic patients to detect and prevent the onset of hypoglycaemia. The next step is to monitor different mental health conditions including depression.
The company was founded in 2015 by Jonas Harder, Sebastian Sujka, Silvan Türkcan and Matteo Carli. They point out that eight people die from a preventable disease every minute. They claim that their technology could save around one million lives by 2020.
In March 2017, xbird was one of 13 companies pitching on the EY Startup Stage at the Wired Health event as it looks for additional funding to grow.

With all the attention artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are getting at the moment, there are big opportunities for companies building expertise in this area.
One such enterprise is Digital Genius. Launched in 2013 and backed by $7.35m (£5.7m) in funding, the company offers a customer service bot, which has been adopted by brands such as KLM.
Integrating CRM tools and working with human customer service operatives, the system speeds up and improves customer service. It automates some of the more routine requests using available data, while freeing up operatives to work one on one with customers to resolve more complex issues.
Seeds were sown while founder Dmitry Aksenov was at college in the UK, but now the company has more than 30 employees between the London and San Francisco serving travel companies as well as BMW, Panasonic and Unilever.

Launched in October 2016, Ozlo is an integrated knowledge platform powering personal assistants that use artificial intelligence (AI).
It competes with Alexa, Siri and Cortana by giving virtual assistants a knowledge base that accounts for the nuances of everyday life, rather than just hard facts. Ozlo helps intelligent systems have conversations designed to convert more frequently into action and improve customer loyalty.
Consumers ask Ozlo questions via a messaging app, and as they interact with the platform it becomes more sophisticated in its reasoning about the user. It also directly references information provided by partner apps and websites in its responses.
Co-founded by Charles Jolley, previously head of platform for Facebook on Android, and Mike Hanson, former entrepreneur in residence at Greylock Partners, the company is headquartered in California with an office in Seattle. It has raised $14m (£10.8m) of funding to date, with investors including AME Cloud Ventures, Greylock Partners and Jerry Yang.

Benevolent AI develops and applies artificial intelligence to enhance and accelerate scientific innovation. Life science papers are published every 30 seconds, there are 10,000 updates on science search engine PubMed a day and 90% of the world’s data was created in the past two years.
“It is impossible for humans alone to process all this information to advance scientific research. Benevolent AI is developing and applying artificial intelligence to probe science’s hidden knowledge,” says founder Ken Mulvany.
The startup was founded in 2013 following the sale of Proximagen, a biotech firm that Mulvany founded and sold to a major US pharma company for $555m (£431m). His experience at Proximagen highlighted the challenges of innovating using a process of scientific discovery that had not changed for 50 years.
Benevolent AI has raised $87m (£67.5m) from blue-chip institutional investors and pharmaceutical companies including Woodford Investment Management and Lansdowne Partners. Its current valuation is $1.7bn (£1.3bn). The company announced a major partnership with Johnson & Johnson in November 2016.

The Babylon Health app lets users book face-to-face consultations with doctors via a smartphone or desktop computer. They can also check symptoms using artificial intelligence (AI), ask medical questions, monitor overall health indicators (including pulse, stress and blood pressure), carry out health tests and keep clinical records in one password protected, secure location.
“The majority of digital healthcare companies simply connect people to doctors through a mobile phone. Our next-generation app will harness the powers of AI and machine learning to not only prevent ill health, but also predict it and intervene when necessary,” says Dr Ali Parsa, CEO and founder of Babylon.
Prior to Babylon, Parsa founded Circle, Europe’s largest partnership of clinicians with £200m of revenue, 3,000 employees and a successful IPO. Babylon currently has more than one million downloads, 800,000 registered users worldwide and is free to 220,000 employees on benefit schemes at 120 companies.

Businesses are increasingly using customer experience to differentiate their brand yet 30% of senior leaders are confused about who should take ownership of it.
Chief marketing officers and other C-suite executives are unclear who should be in charge of the customer experience. This confusion is a key challenge for 30% of the UK and US marketers, CEOs and chief customer officers surveyed by software company Calabrio, which is having a significant impact on the experiences these businesses deliver.
In the UK, for example, less than a third (30%) believe customer experience across all their channels is anything more than ‘satisfactory’.
This data reflects the latest KPMG Nunwood US Customer Experience Excellence report, which finds UK brands are lagging 6% behind their US counterparts in the customer experience stakes.
READ MORE: Why US brands are crushing the UK on customer experience
Failing to deliver on customer experience could prove a significant issue as over half (52%) of senior leaders say customer experience is the most important way they look to differentiate their brand, according to the research.
However, just 35% of CMOs believe it is their responsibility to use customer data insights to improve the customer experience, compared to 37% of CEOs and a mere 29% of chief customer officers (CCOs).
This is significant given 39% of survey respondents believe understanding real-time customer behaviour is the core reason for appointing a dedicated CCO in the first place.
Companies across every sector are adding chief customer officers to their teams. In March, Tesco appointed former Unilever vice-president of food in North America Alessandra Bellini as CCO, while EasyJet promoted head of marketing communications and brand, Ian Cairns, to the new role of director of customer in January.

The continued rise of the CCO is expected to have an impact on the role of senior marketers, with 34% of survey respondents arguing CMOs will have a greater focus on new customer acquisition after a CCO is added to their organisation.
Confusion around the lack of ownership of customer experience is hampering marketers’ efforts to achieve a single customer view.
The research finds 47% of CMOs feel they do not have the right tools to understand their customers’ needs, with 29% still unsure about the number of devices customers use to complete a purchase, for example.
Some 31% of senior leaders generally believe integrating customer data is the greatest challenge their company faces, although 56% think technological improvements and investments in artificial intelligence will help better align the customer experience across all touchpoints.
This perspective is supported by Econsultancy’s ‘Implementing a CX Strategy’ report, which expects the importance of customer journey mapping and creation of customer personas to achieve personalisation will grow, meaning marketing is most likely to own customer experience within a business going forward.
READ MORE: The year ahead in marketing and digital: Part 2 – marketing trends
Improving customer experience in the long term will be crucial, as 67% of respondents agree customer retention rates are the most important measure of customer experience success and will become the CMO’s highest priority over the coming year.
As a result, some 29% say customer retention is their most important priority over the next year, even greater than growth and expansion (21%) and profit (18%), product development (15%), customer acquisition (12%) and brand perception (6%).

If you are truly 360 deg customer focused, the role of a CCO should be under the CEO or COO. The CMO’s office should be focused on supporting customer acquisition and therefore is not the organization to be tasked with all aspects of customer experience delivery.
In a truly customer-centric organization, all customer-facing functions (marketing, sales, customer support, delivery, finance, legal, fulfillment, etc.) should be aligned to deliver the customer experience that their brand promises. You cannot silo CX to just the marketing or customer support functions. Imagine a finance collections person abusing a high worth customer for a late payment… while marketing spends big dollars luring this same customer!
Love this article. And, the title is very intriguing. I believe EVERYBODY should own CX. However, someone has to oversee it.
If marketing is still “the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably” (CIM) or “the science and art of exploring, creating, and delivering value to satisfy the needs of a target market at a profit” (Kotler), it should surely play an essential role and co-own the customer experience. Because marketing is sometimes relegated to organising event and producing collateral, it is where all the problems starts. Everyone within their organisation should be “responsible” for delivering the customer experience, hence employees should understand the purpose of their role and how they are contributing to creating a consistent experience. Essentially, it is a cross-functional approach.
The US has always been better at customer experience than the UK, but the gap is getting wider. In order to improve, UK brands must sharpen their focus on employee engagement, organise themselves around the customer and get back to basics.
Departments such as IT and HR are regularly excluded from customer experience strategy planning, it was revealed at Marketing Week Live.
EasyJet has created a new director of customer role and will merge digital and marketing as part of a team restructure that will allow the low cost airline to focus on customer experience, business travellers and digital innovation.

The internet giant claims its “cutting edge” machine learning work will help advertisers better understand the consumer journey and therefore how their marketing leads to a sale.
Attribution remains one of the more difficult areas of advertising. As Andrew Willshire, founder of analytics company Diametrical, recently wrote for Marketing Week, it nearly always excludes inconvenient data or pointlessly analyses events a marketer can’t influence. Last-click attribution is the model that has dominated the internet, in part because it’s easiest to measure, but it has any number of shortcomings.
READ MORE: Attribution is broken, here’s how to fix it
Now Google is looking at new ways of working out what influences a consumer to make a purchase. Using its work in machine learning and artificial intelligence, it claims to be taking the “complexity out of a very complicated problem” with a new tool called ‘Google Attribution’.
The service is being announced at Google’s annual Google Marketing Next event in San Francisco today (23 May). Essentially, it aims to help marketers better understand how their marketing efforts work together to lead to a sale, and therefore how to make their marketing more efficient and effective.
Speaking on a press call to explain the new service, Google’s vice-president of product management Jerry Dischler, said: “There has never been a more exciting time to be a marketer, especially online, because [brands] can access their customers at any moment throughout the day as they bounce across devices including tablets, mobile and desktop.
“But this has created unprecedented complexity. There is more data, more platforms, more channels. On a daily basis Google Analytics processes half a trillion digital moments across devices. What we are trying to do is use tech and machine learning to help make ad platforms more useful, easier and better connected.”
Google Attribution works by integrating with AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to bring together ad data from across Google to give a more complete view of performance. It is based on tech Google acquired when it bought attribution company Adometry three years ago.
The machine learning works by determining how much credit to assign each step in the consumer journey – whether a first search or a final click before purchase. It analyses each account’s unique conversion patterns to compare the paths of those who convert with those that don’t, meaning personalised results.
Babak Pahlavan, Google’s senior director of product management, claims that where current products on the market are “difficult to set up, require an expert to upload data, lose track of customers when they switch between devices and are not well integrated with bidding tools”, its offering solves these problems.
Google Attribution will roll out globally in beta over the next few months, and is free for any advertiser to use. There will also be an enterprise version ‘Attribution 360’ that Pahlavan says connects with more Google products, such as DoubleClick Campaign Manager and has more sophisticated reports and data import functionality.
The enterprise offering also monitors TV ads as they air and assigns to them any lift seen in search results and website visits.
The second area Google is looking to tackle is online and offline attribution. Here, Google’s offering builds on its store visit tech, which it launched two and a half years ago. It has measured 5 billion store visits across 17 countries and is already used in search, shopping and display campaigns.
We want to help consumers online find what they are looking for in the physical world.
Now Google is expanding that to video and YouTube TrueView campaigns. This will help marketers better understand how video ads impact traffic to stores.
It is also adding the ability to measure in-store revenue, either by retailers importing data from loyalty programmes or through a partnership Google has with an (unnamed) third party that captures 70% of credit and debit card transactions in the US. This will only be available in the US.
Dischler explains: “The offline value of an online ad is just as high, if not higher, than its online value. We want to help consumers online find what they are looking for in the physical world.”
In early testing, Google says it has found that consumers who click on a Google search ad before visiting a store are 25% more likely to make a purchase and spend 10% more on average. And in a Virgin Holidays case study, it found that the brand was generating twice as much profit from its search campaign when it considered both online and store sales, rather than just online.
Measuring the impact of digital marketing has only become more complex and even the platforms offering it are having problems. Facebook has now admitted to 10 separate errors in its measurements, the most recent of which resulted in it over-billing some brands.
This move from Google goes some way to improving measurement and attribution. But marketers will still be relying on Google to get its tech and data right.
Plus while the company claims it is “across all channels” it will still be very difficult to get data that allows a marketer to compare side-by-side using the same metrics how digital advertising compares to more traditional, or indeed how advertising on Facebook compares to Twitter or Snapchat or Google.
READ MORE: Keith Weed – We need comparable metrics in a digital world
Marketers including Keith Weed and Sir Martin Sorrell have previously complained about the big digital firms “marking their own homework”. And this does little to alleviate that concern.
Marketing attribution nearly always excludes inconvenient data or pointlessly analyses events you can’t influence, but with long-term goals and the right audience insights it could work much better.
The climb from CMO to CEO means becoming more accountable and strategic. Relay42’s Tomas Salfischberger looks at why attribution models are less important than continually optimising customer journeys.

The EasyJet CEO advises marketers to think carefully about what innovation really means to both their customers and their business, as well as consider how they can use digital transformation to create a personalised experience.
Innovation is a “very over-used” word according to EasyJet CEO Carolyn McCall, who argues that brands need to assess what impact innovation really has on both their customers and their bottom line.
For a low-cost airline innovation is needed to enhance the customer proposition and reduce costs in order to offer lower fares for passengers, says McCall. One such innovation being implemented by the airline is predictive maintenance powered by artificial intelligence (AI), which allows EasyJet to change an aircraft’s path to avoid delays.
READ MORE: Marketers must reclaim the word ‘innovation’ before it dies
The EasyJet CEO, who was speaking to Marketing Week at Mumsnet’s recent Mumstock event, believes marketers also need to consider how digital transformation can help them personalise the brand experience to create more intimate relationships with consumers.
Developing strong relationships with the finance or HR department is a smart idea for marketers who want to ensure their impact is felt across the organisation.
EasyJet has created a new director of customer role and will merge digital and marketing as part of a team restructure that will allow the low cost airline to focus on customer experience, business travellers and digital innovation.
When it comes to climbing the career ladder and gaining a coveted place at the boardroom table, easyJet’s CEO Carolyn McCall believes marketers are “fantastically” placed to do so. But to become a senior leader, confidence is key.

We round-up all the marketing news that matters around the world this morning.
Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive of Facebook, has declared that the “struggle of our time” is against the forces of authoritarianism and nationalism, as he sets out a political agenda for a more equal, connected world.
Giving the commencement address to Harvard University, he said there was a “battle of ideas not nations” between those who are for the flow of trade and immigration and those who want to slow it down.
Mr Zuckerberg said the millennial generation needs to work so that everyone has a purpose, even those who are losing jobs and community to technology, and everyone has the opportunity to try entrepreneurial ideas.
“There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in ten years, when millions of students can’t afford to pay off their loans, let alone start a business,” he said to a crowd of new graduates and their families gathered in the rain.

New payday loan regulations come into force today (26 May), requiring all online lenders to advertise on at least one price comparison website.
The new rules are the result of an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, published in February 2015.
Lenders are also required to display “prominently” a link on their own websites to a price comparison site. The CMA says this will allow customers to compare loans more easily and establish the best value.
The industry has already complained about the increasing regulation.

Deliveroo has been accused of running a campaign of misinformation and implementing last-minute changes to contracts in an effort to prevent riders from gaining better employment rights.
In a key case relating to the gig economy, the Central Arbitration Committee is investigating whether Deliveroo’s drivers are independent contractors, as the company argues, or whether they should be classified as workers with rights to holiday pay, the national minimum wage and collective bargaining via a union.
Quoting from emails and transcripts of recorded conversations, John Hendy QC, the barrister for the riders, said couriers had been told by Deliveroo managers that if they gained worker status by joining the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) they would no longer be classed as self-employed. He said the riders were also told they could be sacked for not wearing a uniform, would have to work set hours and be paid via PAYE so that they could not manage their own tax affairs.
The food delivery firm tried to have the case dismissed on the basis that not enough riders had expressed an interest in joining the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed strike action by riders last year.

Aviva, the 321-year-old British insurance giant, wants to become a financial technology company in a bid to “change the insurance industry”.
CEO Mark Wilson declared at a press conference on Wednesday: “We want to turn Aviva into a fintech.”
“We will do acquisitions in this space,” he said but added: “I don’t mean billions. There’s nothing imminent.”
Wilson named artificial intelligence and big data as areas of particular interest for Aviva.
Aviva is spending at least £100 million a year on digital transformation internally and has set up a venture capital fund, Aviva Ventures, with £200 million to invest by 2020. So far it has made 6 investments, with a 7th imminent.

The Government’s intelligence agency GCHQ has demanded that directors start taking charge of cyber security, warning that they are “devolving responsibility” for protecting businesses from hackers.
Ciaran Martin, the head of the agency’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said it is unacceptable for boards to plead ignorance about the threat from cyber attacks.
It comes after this month’s debilitating “WannaCry” ransomware outbreak, which caused chaos in the NHS and brought operations at factories and train stations to a halt.
“Our business leaders need to stop saying that cyber security is too complicated – and stop devolving responsibility,” Mr Martin said at The Telegraph Cyber Security conference.

As it continues to evolve its Stories function, Instagram is now testing direct response ads for the Snapchat-esque feature.
It means consumers who look at ads in Instagram Stories can now be prompted by brands to sign-up for a service or install an app.
SumUp, an e-payment device company, has launched an ad on Stories that prompts people to swipe up to sign up for its service. According to Instagram, which up until now has avoided targeted marketing features on Stories, its Stories function will “eventually accomodate all the same marketing objectives that are available from buying ads in the main feed.”

In the US, Facebook has introduced a personal fundraiser option for all of its users above 18.
Working pretty much the same as services such as Just Giving, Facebook says people can create a fundraiser to quickly raise money and easily reach their friends in a few taps, without the need to leave the social media network.
Users can raise money to fund charitable causes in any of the following sectors: education, crisis relief, personal emergency, funeral and loss, sports and community.
Each fundraiser requires a “6.9% + $0.30 fee that goes to payment processing, fundraiser vetting, and security and fraud protection”.

Luxury British car maker Aston Martin has posted a first-quarter profit for the first time in a decade.
The company made a pre-tax profit of £5.9m for the three months to March, following strong sales of its new DB11 model launched late last year. Its revenues, meanwhile, more than doubled (rising 75%) to £188m in the quarter.
Aston Martin, which has made an annual loss for each of the past six years, was sold by Ford in 2007 to Italian and Kuwaiti investment firms. The company has gone bankrupt seven times in its history.
The carmaker hopes that its latest models will increase sales by more than 30% in 2017.

Ben & Jerry’s announced it is barring customers at its 26 stores in Australia from ordering two scoops of the same flavour.
It’s doing so to highlight the lack of marriage equality for LGBTI people in Australia.
“Imagine heading down to your local Scoop Shop to order your favorite two scoops of Cookie Dough in a waffle cone. But you find out you are not allowed – Ben & Jerry’s has banned two scoops of the same flavor. You’d be furious!” said the company in a statement.
“We are banning two scoops of the same flavor and encouraging our fans to contact their MPs to tell them that the time has come – make same sex marriage legal! Love comes in all flavours!”
And in a bid to get its customers writing postcodes urging their MPs to back marriage equality, the ice cream brand is also launching post boxes emblazoned with rainbows in each of its Australian stores.

The Fairtrade Foundation says it is not partnering with the new Sainsbury’s Foundation pilot in tea due to fundamental concerns that it falls below the standards.
With the launch of the new programme, Sainsbury’s own-brand Red Label and Gold Label ranges will no longer be Fairtrade certified, instead these will be part of the supermarket giant’s new “Fairly Traded” range. More than 229,000 farmers will be affected by these changes. 
However, Michael Gidney, CEO of the Fairtrade Foundation, says Sainsbury’s new intitiative falls well below the standard.
He explains: “We are unable to partner with the Sainsbury’s Foundation as it does not yet meet our core priniciples, particularly in the area of producer empowerment.”

UK consumers are increasingly opting for British grocery brands, according to Kantar Worldpanel’s fifth annual Brand Footprint ranking. The study, which measures which brands are most frequently bought by the most British consumers, reveals seven of the top 10 are home grown, up from six last year.
Bolton-based Warburton tops the UK list with 84.2% of the population buying its products an average of 25.2 times a year.
Rival bread brand Kingsmill has also done well – it is the fastest riser in this year’s top 10, with people that buy the brand doing so 8.7% more than they did 12 months ago. It moves up two places to third in the overall ranking with 73.5% of UK consumers buying the brand an average of 15.5 times a year.
Warburton and Kingsmill are joined in the top 10 by Heinz (2), McVitie’s (4), Hovis (5), Walkers (6), Muller (7), Birds Eye (8), Cadbury’s Dairy Milk (9) and Cadbury (10).
Competition from own-label products is starting to have an impact though as overall branded sales have fallen by 1.6% compared to private label brands which have grown by 1.7%.
Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, says it has been a challenging year for brands across all FMCG sectors.
“British retailers have stepped up their own label offer, consolidating and recalibrating their private-label lines in response to consumer demand for quality goods at low prices. The growth of Aldi and Lidl’s market share has also played a role as consumers become accustomed to seeing non-branded products on the shelves. Consumers have responded by increasingly opting for own-label alternatives across all retailers, and the proportion of the population buying the top 10 branded products has fallen by an average 2.5%.”
As post-Brexit price hikes continue to take hold, consumers across the UK are increasingly opting for own brand products, with 48% of consumers stating they would switch to cheaper own-label alternatives if their weekly food bill rose by 3%, according to recent research by Retail Economics,
London-based delivery startup Quiqup plans to take on the likes of Deliveroo and Uber after raising £20m to develop its technology and expand across the UK.
Quiqup has 400 retailers on board already, offering a pick up and delivery service from brands including Uniqlo, the Body Shop, Argos and Whole Foods, Unlike Deliveroo and UberEATS which are limited to food, it has expanded its remit to provide on-demand delivery from pharmacies, grocers and florists too.
The company says it will use the funds to the increase the number of retailers it works with, improve its logistics technology, and launch in more cities across the UK. International expansion is also in its sights.

Instagram has added location and hashtag stories to its Explore function to enable users to find content more easily.
Location stories are found at the top of the search page, and are grouped from people using location stickers on posts. Users can also search by location with a story ring for that place at the top of the location page.
In a move similar to its social media rivals, Instagram is also starting to introduce hashtag stories on Explore to help people find stories based on their interests. When searching for a hashtag users will be shown a story ring at the top of the page with stories related to that topic.

Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s biggest car manufacturer, has delivered record sales driven by demand for its luxury cars in China where it grew 32%.
The car marque sold 604,009 vehicles in the 12 months to the end of March, 16% more than the previous year and the most in its 95-year history.

Amazon is moving into the pay-TV space, a market dominated by Sky Virgin Media and BT. Amazon Channels will see the online firm offer individual subscriptions to more than 40 channels at a cost of between £1.49 and £9.99 a channel with no fixed contract.
Broadcasters including Discovery, ITV and Eurosport have signed up, although others including Channel 4, UKTV and Channel 5 have not, with insiders telling The Telegraph the terms were “rubbish” so they did not sign a deal.

Ford has hired James Hackett, the boss of its self-driving cars division, to be its new CEO as it responds to growing competition in the car market both from traditional rivals and tech companies. He takes over from Mark Fields, who has run the company since 2014. Fields will retire with immediate effect.
Ford chairman Bill Ford Junior, described Hackett as a “transformational leader” who can modernise the business by focusing on areas such as 3D printing, aritifical intelligence and autonomous driving. Ford Jr also wants to speed up decision-making to keep up with newer rivals such as Tesla.
The move was a surprise although concerns about Ford’s growth have been mounting. It announced record profits in 2015 but is struggling more as US car sales drop and is being aggressively targeted by competitors such as General Motors which is going after its truck business. It is also seen as slow to reac to the shift towards electric vehicles, autonomous cars and ride sharing.

Businesses including Barclays, Boots and Aviva are set to unveil plans today (23 May) to increase the number of over-50s they employ by 12% by 2022. They will also publish data about the age of their existing workforce so their progress can be measured.
The move comes in reponse to a skills gap, with 14.5 million people set to leave the workforce as they retire between 2012 and 2022, with just 7 million to enter. The businsses involved are calling on others to follow their lead.
“Businesses will not be able to get the skills, resources and capabilities they need to continue to develop their business unless they find a solution,” Andy Briggs, Aviva’s UK CEO and the government’s business champion for older workers, tells the FT. “One of the solutions will be to create an environment where older people can work for longer.”

The number of deals between large and small business in the UK dropped by 28% in the 2016/17 tax year, according to data released by law firm Bond Dickinson. Deal volumes fell from a peak of 1,536 in 2015/16 to 1,111 in the last tax year. That follows a number of years of growth.
The report suggests economic uncertainty caused by Brexit is impacting deal-making. Nevertheless, large companies still invested £21bn in SMEs in the last year, more than the £16bn invested in research and development. Financial services leads the way with the most transactions as fintech startups disrupt the sector.

EU antitrust investigators will rule in the next few months over whether Google abused its dominance of internet searches, a senior European Commission has said. The investigation comes after concerns were raised over Google promoting its own shopping service in internet searches at the expense of its rivals. If that is found to be the case, Google could face a hefty fine. Google also being investigated over where it has used Android to squeeze out rivals and blocked competitors in online search advertising through its ‘AdSense for Search’ service.
“In the next few months, we will reach a decision on the Google cases, Google search, AdSense and to me the most interesting is Android,” said Tommaso Valletti, the Commission’s chief competition economist, speaking at a conference organised by the University of Oxford Centre for Competition Law and Policy, according to Reuters.

Marks & Spencer is expected to post a 3% slump in its clothing and homewares sales as the festive revival appears short-lived.
Reporting results for the first quarter of 2017 on Wednesday (24 May), the high street retailer is also expected to reveal a sharp fall in annual profits and a small decline in its underlying food business.
These results come after a successful festive period during which Marks & Spencer saw a 2.3% jump in clothing and homeware, coupled with a 1.3% rise in like-for-like sales – its first underlying sales growth for nearly two years.
At the time chief executive Steve Rowe attributed the growth in clothing and home to “better ranges, better availability and better prices”, as well as the retailer’s commitment to substantially reduce discounting, including over Black Friday.
In November, Rowe unveiled a five-year plan to cut trading space devoted to clothing by 10% and focus on the expansion of its food business. This involves the closure of 30 of its 304 “full-line” stores selling clothing, homeware and food, as well as the conversion of a further 45 into food-only shops.

Leaked Facebook policing guidelines show moderators investigate more than 6.5 million reports relating to potentially fake accounts a week.
A Guardian investigation also reveals that remarks such as “Someone shoot Trump” should be deleted, because as a head of state President Donald Trump is in a protected category. Conversely, anyone with more than 100,000 followers is designated as a public figure, thereby denying them the full protection of a private individual.
The 100-plus Facebook training manuals leaked to the newspaper also advise moderators that videos of violent deaths should be marked as disturbing, but not always deleted as they raise awareness of mental health issues. Furthermore, people are allowed to livestream attempts to self-harm so as to not “censor or punish people in distress”.
A further guideline indicates that photos of non-sexual physical abuse and the bullying of children do not have to be deleted unless there is a sadistic or celebratory element.
Sources speaking to the Guardian reveal that moderators feel overwhelmed by the volume of work and often have “just 10 seconds” to make a decision.

Jaguar Land Rover is expected to report annual revenues of more than £23bn, boosted by a 16% rise in car sales to 604,000 during the year to the end of March.
Britain’s biggest car manufacturer has benefitted in large part from the resurgence of Jaguar, which saw sales rocket 83% to almost 173,000 cars, driven by demand for its first sports utility style car F-Pace. The mainstay of the business, Land Rover sales grew 1% to 431,000.
The company has benefitted from the weakening pound as only a fifth of its cars are sold in the domestic market. During the period sales to China rose by a third to more than 130,000, as Jaguar Land Rover also saw its US sales grow by a quarter to 125,000.

Convenience chain McColl’s is eyeing the potential takeover of Tesco’s One Stop chain in a bid to add 50 shops a year to its existing 1,300 store estate.
Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, chief executive Jonathan Miller said he expected Tesco would be forced to offload its One Stop brand or hundreds of Tesco Express shops in order to secure official clearance of its merger with the wholesaler Booker, first announced in January.
McColl’s ramped up its growth strategy in December with the completion of a deal to buy 298 Co-operative Group stores.

From training staff to driving one-on-one brand engagement, Adidas, Just Eat and HTC are using chatbots in very different ways, but each is learning rapidly about the opportunities they could offer.
Adidas has ramped up interest in its recently launched female-focused community space Studio LDN, by using a chatbot to create an interactive booking process.
The studio, which opened earlier this year, offers a series of weekly free-to-attend fitness sessions especially for women, with the ultimate goal of boosting brand engagement.
The Facebook Messenger chatbot, created by marketing technology agency Byte London, is the only way to find out about sessions and register, so it has been integral to driving awareness and the success of the initiative.
“One of the main appeals of a chatbot was that it allows for ongoing, deeper engagement with our consumers through regular one-to-one conversations,” Sarah Gower, managing editor at Adidas London Newsroom, tells Marketing Week.
“It also offers agility in a fast-paced social landscape with new broadcasts being published weekly.”
The chatbot is the only place where consumers can find weekly schedules and information about the classes on offer. It is also the only way people can sign up to participate, but Gower says it was an obvious choice for the brand.
Our target consumers are early adopters of social innovation so a chatbot is the perfect vehicle for us to communicate with them.
“Our target consumers are early adopters of social innovation so a chatbot is the perfect vehicle for us to communicate with them. The Adidas women’s chatbot is an extension of the physical space, which also helps to ensure that all information within it is timely and relevant.”
In the first two weeks alone 2,000 people signed up to participate, with repeat use at 80%. Retention after week one was 60%, which the brand claims is far greater than what could have been achieved with an app.
Sessions are reportedly fully booked within minutes and hundreds have signed up for regular alerts. To drive engagement further, as soon as a booking has been made the user receives reminders and messages from influencer fitness instructors. They can also access fitness videos for inspiration.
Adidas promotes the chatbot via its website, at the studio and on merchandise. Facebook ads, direct mail and membership cards with the Messenger logo are also used to promote the initiative.
Gower is positive about the results and says Adidas will look to use chatbots as part of other activity going forward.
“We’re always looking for opportunities to enhance the Adidas social ecosystem. Experimentation with innovations like chatbots is a key part of this,” she adds.

HTC has transformed the way it trains salespeople, while driving greater awareness and conversation about its products, using a chatbot.
Ben Walsh, head of marketing, Europe, UK & Ireland at HTC, says the brand is “always alert to new and better ways of reaching customers” and chose to use a chatbot in a B2B training capacity because it “enabled direct, friendly and engaging communication with staff”, both internally and at retail partners such as Carphone Warehouse and Three.
Once set up he says it was “way more effective” than methods it has used previously, as well as being more cost efficient.
“To get the same level of engagement with thousands of salespeople we would need thousands of field team members. Our field team is 30 people but we are chatting to thousands on Facebook. It’s a clever way of delivering engaging scale where you usually rely on humans.”
Walsh says staff have found it “just as personal” and it means information can be shared quickly with people on the shop floor
If we can do it in a B2B space in a managed environment we can take it to the B2C environment.
“When you have a great digital experience it can be like a better version of a human interaction because it’s on your terms, and it’s telling you what you want to know without too much of the airs and graces of a human interaction. It gets to the point.”
Getting the tone right is crucial though, he warns.
In addition to delivering training, the chatbot also tests product knowledge with competitions like the monthly quiz and rewards staff with HTC products and gift vouchers if they get a certain number of answers right.
HTC sales representatives promote the chatbot and monthly quizzes on store visits to encourage engagement, with 40% of people who use it completing the quiz.
HTC is now looking at the opportunities chatbots might provide for B2C activity.
Walsh says: “If we can do it in a B2B space in a managed environment we can take it to the B2C environment – that’s really always been the intention. If it works in the existing environment then of course we scale it to go outwards and that is something we are looking at.”

Just Eat has added an element of fun to finding takeaways by installing a chatbot that lets people search restaurants near them with emojis and keywords.
People can type “breakfast” or send any food emoji to get the best results near them, in what is designed to be a more conversational process than ordering via the app.
Ben Carter, UK marketing director at Just Eat, describes the move as “a key part of our armoury to engage with our customers on a daily basis”.
“We have tapped into is a real insight that people are passionate and emotional about food but they like to get food inspiration and understand what food is available in their area,” adds Carter.
Since launching in September thousands of people have used it, with the average user spending 1.53 minutes interacting with the bot.
It has helped drive new customers, encourage repeat orders – 13.5% are repeat users – and improved awareness of Just Eat’s 27,600 partner restaurants. Data shows the chatbot drove a 266% higher conversion rate than interacting with an average social ad in November 2016.
It’s key to Just Eat’s DNA that we are seen as a tech disruptor.
Carter says the brand is “continually innovating” and will absolutely look to develop its chatbot offer.
“It’s not a one off for us. We haven’t built it, done PR and switched it off. We have kept it on, and are iterating,” he says.
“It’s key to Just Eat’s DNA that we are seen as a tech disruptor. It’s about making sure we can have conversations and engage with customers through as many platforms as possible. That is why we were one of the launch partners with Amazon Alexa as well.”
Just Eat is now launching phase two of its chatbot, which will allow customers to reorder directly through the bot.
The chatbot is not simply used as an engagement tool though. The brand is also learning valuable information about how customers interact with it that it is feeding into other areas of the business.
“As a business that operates at scale – we processed 88 million orders last year from 9 million customers – we have a big customer service operation. What we are doing all the time is taking the learning from the bot and using it to develop more automated chat services,” he says.
He warns brands off investing in chatbots if the purpose is purely to gain column inches though.
“The key thing for me is be authentic to the technology,” says Carter. “Think about what your customers want and how they want to engage with you.

A new Forrester report claims consumers’ hatred of interruption is killing online advertising and brands should invest in AI instead. Are the digital disruptors about to be disrupted?
Given my antipathy to the ‘death’ theme that haunts every possible marketing moment currently, the likelihood of my agreeing with a report entitled ‘The End of Advertising As We Know It’ was slim.
The fact that the report was written by Forrester, one of the few firms to understand properly and objectively the intersection of marketing and tech, did slightly re-balance things. But not enough to avoid the very loud “harrumph” I uttered as I read a precis of the report last week.
For as long as we have had advertising there has been an angry ex-agency bozo or half-arsed futurologist predicting the imminent demise of the ignoble profession. A zippy Google search for the “end of advertising as we know it” will reveal a best-selling book from 2000, a series of inane conference presentations from 1990s and, more recently, a whole raft of tech-based attacks that portay traditional communications as being a dead marketing man walking.

I don’t know the name of the ancient Greek opportunist who first carved the name of a taverna on a wall with directions beneath it and invented the advertising industry. But I’ll bet there was some miserable prick stood next to him as he chipped away, shaking his head and telling everyone that it would not last. Such is advertising.
Quite clearly advertising has evolved tremendously in the past 20 years. A surprising amount of it also hasn’t changed at all by the way, but we don’t talk about these things in marketing lest we be seen as ‘old-school’ and not sufficiently au fait with the startling new world of digital marketing. But change is not what the Forrester report is about. The co-authors are truly dead-set on a prediction that the end is very much nigh.
The big insight on which Forrester is basing its “declaration” that 2017 is the year that advertising as we know it comes to an end is the increasing intolerance we all have for interruptions. That is, after all, the name for the small uncomfortable corner of experience where advertising lives and occasionally emerges from to occupy your consciousness for a few tantalising moments of engagement.
There is something delicious in seeing Facebook and Google suddenly threatened with a digital disruption of their own.
Forrester point outs, not without accuracy, that consumers are spending less and less time “doing interruptible things on interruption-friendly devices”. Despite their current domination, Google and Facebook’s model for success is disarmingly old-fashioned. Google make billions interrupting your search with paid suggestions. Facebook interrupt your social interactions with paid messages. Clearly, once we navigate the issues of brand safety and measurement, the next big bump for digital media is the fact that this is a singularly inappropriate context to try and interrupt a user’s experience for even a second.
The active-finger, multi-screen, double-click world of your smartphone makes it just about the most impossible 10 square inches imaginable to break into and garner attention, let alone drive action. There is a reason that you need to show the average digital display ad to 2,000 people before one of them will click on it.

The great irony of Mark Zuckerberg’s vision for Facebook ads back in 2007 – in which he too claimed an end to advertising as we knew it and proposed engaging organically with consumers in conversation as equals – was that, although it did not actually work, it was the ideal approach to get past the always-on, never-interrupted digital audiences of the 21st century. It’s ironic because Zuckerberg quickly gave up on organic conversations and opted for an all too familiar model of display advertising, much like the one he had set out to disrupt a few years earlier.
And, of course, not only is the digital consumer pretty much out of bounds from an attention point of view, the device she is using is equally uncooperative. The advent of ad blockers, as Forrester notes, is increasing not because the ads suck but because any sane human being, given the option of free extinction, will click the ad blocker button in an instant. Whether we want to admit it or not, the ancient technology of interruption sits uncomfortably in the age of digital media.
But before the guffaws of the so-called traditional media get too loud, it’s worth noting that the end of interruptions is by no means an exclusively digital phenomenon. As households grow used to smart TVs and DVR content their ability to zip through advertising with expert aplomb grows ever more concerning. Once again technology plays into the consumer’s hands too with an increasing proportion of DVR devices around the world now able to not only pre-record your favourite shows but also re-present them shorn of ads too.
For Forrester the only hope for advertisers is to see the end of interruptions as the end of advertising itself and ship money across town to artificial intelligence (AI) and smart assistants. It recommends that “marketers take billions of dollars out of digital display advertising to make this investment”.
The passivity of the TV audience ironically makes it far more immune to the interruption issue.
There is something delicious in seeing the big tech disruptors of the 21st century, Facebook and Google, suddenly threatened with a digital disruption of their own. But this recommendation to pull back from digital and go deep into AI seems a knee-jerk one to me – a bit like seeing a gust of wind then rushing off to the supermarket to panic buy tins of beans and water.
There is a fascinating future appearing on the horizon in which our smart personal assistants handle most of our purchases for us. It’s a scary world for marketers because those smart devices won’t be watching ads but rather using a complex array of calculations and predictive modelling to make the optimum purchase.
Low-involvement consumer decision-making will become a contradiction in terms and with it all the brands and campaigns that populated our early consumer consciousness will fall foul of evolution. If Amazon gets Alexa right the Andrex puppy will be left, forgotten and unwelcome, on the back step of every British household with only a bunch of soggy, squabbling meerkats for company.
It is brands as well as advertising we are talking about. As marketing professor Scott Galloway has recently noted, in the world of proper AI, basic categories could well replace brands in our verbal requests. Let the machine work out which one to get; I just need toothpaste.
And it’s not just ancient brands that lose out. Google, for all its power and heft, operates a two-step model of consumer information. I search for information on pen refills with Google, then I visit the site and make the purchase. That’s radically more efficient than having to piss off down to the pen shop and talk to an ancient old bloke about pens for an hour.

But that farty old pen shop experience is exactly how our children will see our current use of Google. They will laugh as we talk to them about ‘typing’ a request into a ‘search engine’ to find possible pen retailers and ‘clicking’ on the best options. The little black disc on the bookshelf that orders stuff for my future 22-year-old daughter with one verbal command is where things are going.
Before we get completely caught up in all of this, however, let us pause and consider what we know about marketing revolutions. Inevitably, we overestimate the impact of new technologies and we underestimate how long it will take for them to take hold. Forrester appears to be of the belief that it’s time to jump ship now, declare advertising dead and start working on an AI strategy. If we have learned anything thus far in marketing it’s that these revolutions occur with much slower speed than anyone expects.
While it’s headline-grabbing to declare all advertising is over, the truth is that the interruption extinction event only screws up certain media, not others. Yes, it’s a big fucking problem for the agile, mercurial audiences that populate digital media. But while TV is struggling with its own interruption issues the simple laziness and passivity of the TV audience ironically makes it far more immune to the interruption issue.
Advertising may be changing but it’s not dead or dying or about to be replaced by a black disc.
Many years ago I studied a bunch of families in their own homes and looked at why and how they actually viewed TV advertising. When I finished my research an army of agencies all asked me the same question; which ads pull best? My answer was a disappointment to them. It was clear from thousands of hours of watching families watching advertising that the ads themselves were a relatively tiny force in the overall advertising equation.
Only agencies would think their ads were somehow the main factor in driving attention. The real, ethnographic truth was that a host of more mundane factors explained why a family did or did not pay attention to ads. Where they with someone else they could chat to in the break? Did they want a piss? Were they exhausted? Could they find the remote to change channel?
All these years later, the fundamental quotidian exhaustion of a TV audience remains its biggest strength. It might look great to have young, eager audiences devouring digital at 400 clicks a second. But try getting them to watch a 15-second film.
When arses sink into couches across the UK and turn on a TV, however, they do so with an inbuilt ability to accept interruption. The slightly overweight, pissed and exhausted army that make up most TV audiences might not look good on a brochure for Thinkbox but they have one unerring advantage over the young, hip trendies whizzing through hyperspace: they can’t be fucked to change the channel because the remote is over there. So they endure.
And then there are all those other media that no-one mentions anymore. Both cinema advertising and outdoor are almost immune to the interruption issue because they intrude at such a gigantic, macro level they look set to avoid the issue almost entirely. It’s pretty hard to ignore a billboard when you are driving past it.
The more I think about outdoor advertising and the renewed lease of creative and client life it is getting from becoming digitised, the more bullish I become about this most ancient of advertising forms.
So is advertising as we know it about to end? No, it is surely not. What is going to happen is that all those hot little startups like Google and The Facebook that grew and came to enjoy the fruits of global success are now going to experience the other side of the sword. That’s the part where young, arrogant tech heads spy weakness and money in equal measure and spend the rest of their youth in a basement building something to disrupt the former disruptors.
But Google can rest easy for a while longer. Advertising as we know it may be changing – I’d argue it has not stopped changing since its invention – but it’s not dead or dying or about to be replaced by a black disc. And even if it is, how do consumers get to know about the AI in the first place? Surely someone will have to make an ad to start the revolution.
Nice one.
I thought you lost the plot for a moment and joined the rest of the industry on their new unicorn hunt until I read the ‘Disruption is slower than you think” part.
The great thing about advertising is that nobody takes it personally. That is why it doesn’t sit easily in the digital space where people want to be treated as people, not members of an audience. To be a ‘brand’ you need to lay on a show for the whole audience and, for the time being, advertising is a good way of doing that so long as there continue to be audience-based channels for it to live in.
Exactly. As a rule of thumb, even successful new technologies take 20 years to become the new normal.  
And some take a lot longer. For example LED lightbulbs were invented in 1962 (55 years ago) and are just now becoming mainstream.
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/who-invented-the-new-lightbulb/379905/
Outdoor, and drive-time radio, remain excellent advertising tools. I don’t see them disappearing anytime soon. I also have a lot of time for specialist consumer and B2B magazines, and while they may move from print to digital, it is still highly likely that advertisers will want to present their products somewhere alongside infotainment related to their product categories.
Enjoyable post and good to hear the voice of reason. Too much next big thing, knee jerk reaction is sadly undermining the profession. Agree very few advertising mediums die out completely they just morph and improve or become more of an occasional tactical tool rather than a core communication strategy.
Also re digital it makes me laugh, that a medium so young and based on banners, pop up’s etc which are so fundamentally crap, that it is quite clear it has a lot of leeway to evolve  and with it unbelievable potential  if utilised properly.  But that only comes from people who truly understand marketing, not a bunch of tech geeks who only follow formulas and obsessed with reach, no nothing about truly building a brand.  I believe you are absolutely right, some of these big tech players are in for a very, very, nasty shock.
A trio of unhumble points from Stateside. First, a minor but important point – Google’s product that interrupts us is their display advertising network (GDN) not their AdWords product which is adjacent not interruptive. Secondly, you disappoint gravely with your smarmy love for the anachronistically enduring research sham, Forrester. Next you’ll be trying to convince us Nielsen has an insightful clue worth subscribing to. But lastly, bravo to you for even flirting with falling in love with conversational media (e.g. AI-enabled bots, agents, skills, APIs) as the welcome force already replacing “advertising” with value.   Boy, do I have a deck for you.

A very smart chap giving a talk at Cannes last year (yes, some of Cannes is still useful for work!) forecast that 90% of Googles revenue would come from AI not ads by 2020. I think they’re safe.
Also, it strikes me that ‘The death of (insert subject here)’ is perhaps an excellent example of traditional interruptive advertising by publisher/personal brands. It creates an impact, illicits a reaction and drives conversation. Not overly distinctive though!
You’re uninformed about “who” is creating AI.
All those basement AI developers you mention are using API’s developed by Google, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft.  So maybe you’re right about Facebook ad revenue but do you really think  that Google creates the AI that it will cause their own disruption?  Doubtful.  I’m sure it will morph…They’ll stay on top.  Not to mention They’re globally launching tens of thousand of free wifi balloons to get the remaining 4 billion human online so they’ll own the airwaves
There is , as you say, something delicious in seeing Facebook and Google suddenly threatened with a digital disruption of their own.
Except that they aren’t. Google is the single largest investor in terms of AI acquisitions. In the last 4 years, they’ve bought up deep learning startup DNNresearch (from the computer science department at the University of Toronto),  DeepMind Technologies for some $600M, and in the last , it’s acquired visual search startup Moodstock, bot platform Api.ai and most recently  predictive analytics platform Kaggle. Oh, and Facebook comes in third, having  Facebook acquired Masquerade Technologies and  Zurich Eye recently.
If you can’t beat ’em, as they say, join ’em.
Or better still, if you have the money, buy ’em. That’s how you stay ahead.
I´m with Jason and Tim.
Google, Facebook, Amazon and their likes, are developing AI for personal assistants. The “ads” are going to be more relevant and inserted in the conversation.
Typical examples:
1. Your assistant will inform you that your car need new brake pads, will inform you the nearest shops to do the replacement, give you their time availability, price, promotions, ask you if you want to book a rental car wile yours is in the shop, schedule everything for you.
2. You are messaging with your friends deciding what to do friday night, your assistant, and their’s will suggest restaurants, based on preferences – food, location… –  you will decide and the assistant will book it for you.
Any of this businesses will have to pay to get more mentions on those conversations…
I wouldn’t put much money on marketing agencies on the next cple of years
Marketers love to predict the death of established ideas, but in reality nothing in marketing ever dies and things change much more slowly than you think.
The time old parable of the scorpion and the frog sums up exactly why marketers are choosing digital over traditional marketing – it’s in most marketers’ nature to favour new over old, even if there’s no evidence to suggest it makes sense.
Human nature evolves at a glacial pace but we still want a constant stream of new technology that adds value. Marketers must adapt to change while recognising some needs stay the same, says OpenJaw Technologies’ CMO.
The social network seems to think that finding and admitting its errors will pacify marketers but they will not be happy until they get full, independent, third-party verification.

There are simple ways to make your media spend more effective, starting with a clear plan and ensuring agencies are incentivised by your success.
You might think marketers know exactly how to manage their media buying, but many make basic mistakes that a little inside knowledge could prevent. So here’s a practical guide for advertisers seeking to get the best out of what is usually their biggest investment. The things an advertiser needs to do fall into three stages.
First, you need to decide what you want. Obvious? Well, it might surprise you to know that many advertisers aren’t quite sure. In seeking to cover multiple bases, they end up doing several jobs badly, rather than the one they should be doing well.
So you’ll have to put a proper brief together, against whose clear and prioritised KPIs you and your chosen partners can be held to account.
You’ll need to decide if you want to do media, or any part of it, yourself. Many have brought search advertising in-house (often successfully) and some are now bringing programmatic in too (though the jury is still out on this).
Reflect very carefully on how to become your agency’s favoured client. Clue: skinning them on margin does not work.
A handful negotiate media pricing themselves and use agencies to implement, and this number may grow with the advent of new artificial intelligence-driven models. For now, it’s standard practice to use a media agency that has specialist expertise, resource and enjoys credit terms and commissions from the media owners.
You might have used one you’ve really liked in a previous guise. More likely you’ll need a formalised process, calling a pitch. This requires matchmaking and evaluation expertise. The UK advertiser body, ISBA, and several independent consultancies offer the former, whereas the latter is the domain of media consultants and auditors.
READ MORE: Bob Wootton – How brands lost confidence in media buying
You need to have a clear view on the relative importance to your company of strategy, planning, innovation, optimisation, pricing, and short-term flexibility, as some pull in different directions.
A strong word here on demarcation: you need to be very clear on how you expect your agencies to collaborate. I heard a football team analogy the other day that worked for me – a team of individual stars working to a higher, common goal. You’re the manager.
Once you’ve seen pitches, navigated your and colleagues’ differences and picked a favourite, it’s time to negotiate, agree terms and formalise these into a contract. Again, ISBA offers its member advertisers a model contract template, though it’s not particularly popular with agencies as it’s strict.
Media pricing cannot be overlooked, but it’s much more important to focus on business outcomes. (Ask anyone who has worked agency-side – they can always deliver better media pricing in response to procurement pressure by changing media and channel mix.)
One thing you should reflect on very carefully is how to become your agency’s favoured, go-to-first, client. Clue: skinning them on margin does not work. History has shown it fosters opacity and dishonesty.
READ MORE: ‘Digital media is a buyer’s market, but that doesn’t make it a good deal’
Agree a remuneration floor based on the fixed costs they incur on your behalf and then create a tiered scale of rewards if they – and you – succeed. Don’t nickel and dime them; offer a real opportunity to participate in your success.
Now you’re set up and ready to go, you can move onto the second phase. 
You’ve selected your agencies from a parade of experts to do things you can’t, so why not listen to and accept their recommendations, at least until such time (hopefully never) as you can prove they’re off-beam?
The stakes easily justify your taking time to develop direct relationships with key media owners.
Develop a close, honest and open relationship. Demand their best advice, sometimes even as a critical friend. Agency people are invariably bright and capable. You’re at the head of the value chain so it’s for you to take the lead. Read them carefully – they should embrace it. If not, you may have early sight of a problem.
Demand that all recommendations are based on good data: robust insights from your own and their proprietary and syndicated studies, industry-agreed audience currencies (BARB, UKOM et al), and online best practice standards (JICWEBS) for viewability, brand safety, freedom from endemic fraud and even engagement.
The stakes easily justify your also taking time to develop direct relationships with key media owners on a straight money-at-risk basis – certainly your top five suppliers, preferably more.
Yes, it’s extra work for you and the agency might push back, believing it dilutes their influence, but it’s your company’s money. The media owners will welcome you, so enjoy that – just be firm that you’re not opening a back door through which they can sell to you at a higher price.
As activity runs, it’s time for phase three.
Frequent reviews against plans, targets and KPIs go without saying. Check media buying is competitive through performance auditing, if not continuously, then often. Periodically, check agency adherence to the contract through compliance auditing. It makes obvious sense to engage the media consultant that helped you at pitch as they already have skin in the game.
Since you have set up an open and honest relationship, are paying your agency enough, and are incentivising them to drive your business, there should be no alternative but to work through issues as they arise in pursuit of continuous improvement.
If this looks daunting, it’s only because there’s a lot at stake and you’re in the driving seat. The adage is as true as ever: advertisers get the agencies – and the media – they deserve.
Bob Wootton was director of media and advertising at ISBA and is now principal of Deconstruction Consulting.
Media agency consolidation and margin pressure from procurement departments mean kickbacks take precedence over clients’ interests, while online media buying still isn’t transparent enough, says Bob Wootton, principal of Deconstruction Consulting and former ISBA director.
Digital media are fast becoming dominant in brand marketing but can they deliver long-term effectiveness as well as short-term results, reaching both the masses and targeted audiences?

With Amazon’s advertising business growing fast there’s speculation it could step up its efforts to take on Google and Facebook, and become the third major player in the digital ad market.
Amazon dominates the ecommerce world despite having not made much of an impact in the ad market, but could this be about to change?
At the moment, Facebook and Google have a clear duopoly of the digital advertising market. The pair’s combined market share is set to hit 49% in 2017, according to eMarketer, while Enders Analysis estimates they accounted for 89% of the growth last year.
Central to this dominance has been the unstoppable rise of mobile. In North America, for example, Google controls nearly a third of the US mobile ad market while Facebook owns almost a quarter. Yet this could all soon change, with Amazon prepared to hit the accelerate button.
Yes, Amazon is still a small fish in a very big pond when it comes to digital advertising, with its business so new it’s categorised as ‘other’ in its financials. But all the signs point to Amazon seeking out a far bigger slice of the market.
Those eMarketer stats show Amazon saw its global ad revenues rise by 60% in 2016 to $1.4bn. And the research firm predicts that will grow to become a $2.84bn business by 2019.
READ MORE: Diageo looks to ‘close the circle’ between content and sales with Amazon tie-up
Yet this is still just a tiny portion of the total market. To put Amazon’s numbers into perspective, Google generated digital ad revenues of $62.59bn in 2016, and Facebook $26.89bn. They are still very much the Goliaths to Amazon’s David. And with Google predicted to hit $96bn in ad revenues by 2019, Amazon has a lot of catching up to do.
However, coming from behind is something Amazon has proved time and again it is very good at. Having revolutionised ecommerce, it is now seeking to establish itself in sectors including clothing, events, groceries, film and cars. Advertising would just be one more string to its bow.
It is already convincing some advertisers of the advantages. Just this week, for example, Diageo revealed plans for a new travel TV series that will appear on Amazon’s streaming service Amazon Prime Video.
When describing why Amazon appeals, Diageo Reserve’s World Class global director Johanna Dalley explained: “We wanted to work with Amazon from an audience and scale perspective, but critically it also offered us the ability to link through to purchase.”
The fact two companies dominate the global online advertising market isn’t good for anybody
And Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of the world’s largest ad group WPP, believes Amazon is a huge threat to Google when it comes to search. In March, Sorrell said: “It’s early days with Amazon, you never know what’s going to happen. But we put together an agency in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered, specifically to deal and cater to them.”
Amazon itself has only recently started talking about its ambitions in advertising. Speaking on its most recent analyst call, Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky said the ecommerce giant has a “good strategy” for fighting the likes of Google, with the company currently working on adding more features such as pre-roll video ads.
He said: “Our goals in the ad space are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations. We think that’s a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience.”
Amazon’s results also show ad revenues are small but rising rapidly. In its first quarter ending 31 March 2017, its “other” business division, which is mostly made up of ad revenues, rose 58% to hit $850m.
But if Amazon is to make any serious headway, what will be the key battlegrounds? Data is certainly one of them.
Amazon operates further down the purchase funnel than Google and therefore it has access to more first-party consumer purchase data; something that will be very attractive to brand partners, a point perhaps validated by Diageo’s comments.
“Advertisers are realising that Amazon’s search intent is in many cases more valuable as it happens further down the purchase funnel, in comparison to Google search, where people are more likely to be doing a search at the beginning of their purchase journeys,” explains Lars Glenne, head of media strategy at DigitasLBi.
Equally as important on the data front is Amazon’s ubiquity. It offers home entertainment, ecommerce and search meaning it knows a lot about its customers.
He adds: “Amazon’s on and offline ecosystem, in which it can potentially capitalise to deliver audiences under one lens across platforms and screens, is rapidly extending across retail, FMCG, fashion, entertainment, delivery, the internet-of-things, content production, which means it can aim for one platform that users don’t need to leave.”
And with its artificial intelligence platform Alexa gaining traction, Amazon is also “wisely” building for the future of search advertising; voice. “With the Alexa platform and also integration into internet-of-things applications, Amazon is organically capturing a slice of the future voice search market,” says Glenne. “How large it will be is difficult to predict but they will likely be in a position to challenge Google.”
Despite the considerable gap in ad revenues, Mediacom CEO Josh Krichefski says there’s already evidence Amazon is putting pressure on Google and Facebook. Its ad tech is increasingly being used by big brands and Krichefski points to Amazon’s Advertising Platform (AAP) recently surpassing Google’s DoubleClick Bid Manager (DMB) to become the most-used demand-side platform (DSP).
He says Amazon has also launched a header tool that allows publishers to target Amazon audiences on their own inventory: “This is potentially a big blow for Google’s DoubleClick for Publishers solution, which had established over 90% dominance in the market.”
With so many brands dropping their advertising from Google due to fears they were appearing next to extremist content and well-publicised measurement metric errors bringing negative headlines for Facebook, Mediacom’s Krichefski believes Amazon can sense an opening.
“There is no hiding the fact that Google faces huge challenges to safeguard brands. While there remains confusion about the various issues around ad placement and brand protection, the fact is that consumers and businesses read those headlines and some brand relationships with Google are now on shaky ground,” he says.
“As such, it’s no surprise to see companies like Amazon looking to provide an alternative.”
Amazon will build its advertising business slowly, so there won’t be concerns about immediately monetising
Krichefski’s rationale is that if you’re an electronics brand, it could be more valuable advertising on a search platform such as Amazon as that’s a place where a consumer is actively looking to buy. Measurement would also be easier and there is much less danger of advertising appearing next to unsavoury content.
According to Dominic Grounsell, global head of digital marketing at Travelex, marketers are already “excited” by the alternative of Amazon in the wake up of The Times investigation.
“For me the best opportunity in digital is linked to the ability to target effectively and Amazon are one of the best at doing that. They have massive data on consumers and huge reach as a brand and online business, so their ability to potentially leverage my own brand is very exciting,” he explains.
However, achieving scale in the digital advertising space won’t be easy. Especially with Google’s search and YouTube platform still so dominant.
Mediacom’s Krichefski explains: “Amazon doesn’t have a scaled video offering to match YouTube and although there is scope for Amazon’s search to grow, Google search was not affected in the way YouTube and display were [by the brand safety scandal].”
Amazon will also find it hard getting to get to scale “quickly enough”, with a test-and-learn approach to digital advertising not likely to lead to Amazon making “serious in-roads for quite some time,” according to Grounsell.
Amazon isn’t the only business looking to turn up the heat on Google and Facebook either. Verizon appears set on driving up competition following its acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo. The newly-created offering, Oath, hopes to create a compelling advertising business that could finally have the scale to compete.
Snap Inc is another firm looking to become that third player. Its first results since going public might have disappointed, with total ad revenues hitting just $141.3m, but it is growing fast with total revenues up 236% year on year. It is clear advertisers and agencies see the opportunity in reaching the Amazon audience, but it will have to prove business impact and ROI to have a hope of stealing money from the big two.
There’s also the question of whether Amazon is overexposing itself by extending into so many different sectors; not that that seems to have phased it too much in the past.
“I guess people will pass judgement and say Amazon needs to calm down a little,” says Travelex’s Grounsell. “But the reality is Amazon has been very  successful in pretty much everything it has attempted to do; it wins more than it loses.
“Amazon is likely to build its advertising business slowly. It is a business that doesn’t look for immediate returns so there won’t be concerns about immediately monetising. Amazon will take a 10-year view.”
Ultimately, competition will be good for the marketing industry whether it’s Amazon, Verizon or Snapchat that leads the charge, according to RBS Group CMO David Wheldon.
He concludes: “The fact two companies dominate the global online advertising market isn’t good for anybody. If anybody can make it more competitive and eradicate the stranglehold of the current duopoly then it will be Amazon.”
If you only look at ad revenues then you are probably right in that Amazon can muscle its way to one of the top positions as an advertising platform although the fact that, currently, it is more or less a managed platform will remove it from the radar of many smaller businesses unless they are actually selling their product on Amazon, which is self-serve.
A more likely scenario is that more platforms will come to the fore based on their “fit” for particular campaigns, e.g. B2B campaigns aimed at the professions – no finer place than LinkedIn for your ads. If you want to hit the consumer and AdWords isn’t performing – go to Facebook, it’s already the platform of choice for many marketers who want to generate enquiries from B2C consumers and, at the moment, it costs a lot less than AdWords, (LinkedIn, unfortunately, usually costs more). Factor in Bing Ads (inc’ Yahoo), Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest and you will see a much more complex picture emerging than the rather simplistic 1-2-3 that this article hints at.
Facebook themselves have already implied that growth could be a problem due to lack of available ad space – something which Google has addressed with their extensive display Network.
I don’t know whether the author of this piece is counting YouTube with the Google heading but, ownership aside, it would be a mistake to do so – YouTube advertising is still fairly cheap and there is plenty of available capacity – watch this one grow like crazy over the next few years as business’ fear of video is overcome.
Facebook says it isn’t worried about backlash from advertisers following its metrics error last year as it urges the ad industry to come together to solve the measurement challenge.

Heineken’s new purpose-driven ad might express all the right values, but marketers must remember if you don’t use your budget to create sales, you’ve failed.
The ad of the month is clearly the new ‘Open Your World’ four-minute spot from Heineken. The campaign has created acres of coverage and tons of social media response. But is it any good? Before I answer that question, let me tell you about an experience I had a couple of years ago.
I was invited to pitch to the global marketing team of a large, prestigious brand. They were looking for a major piece of international marketing training. I was up against two bigger firms but I fancied my chances given I knew the sector well and the company in question had specifically invited me to make a presentation.
Off I went to their European HQ for a presentation of my credentials and some examples of the programmes I had designed and delivered for other clients. It was going very well and, to be honest, I was already starting to think about the long and enjoyable road ahead. Near the end of my meeting one of the client team asked me why I so clearly enjoyed being a marketing professor. It’s a familiar question and I launched straight into my usual answer.
“Money,” I explained. “I like making money for clients.” This is true by the way. More than clever strategies or cool executions, the thing I adore most about working with companies is coming up with a strategy that eventually makes them very large sums of money; money that, without my and their intervention, would otherwise not have transpired. I waxed lyrically about how aroused I get when a strategy works and money is made for quite a while.
I do care about things other than money, but I handle them in what I like to call ‘my life’.
When I finished my little soliloquy, you could have cut the air with a knife. Something I had said had clearly gone down very poorly. Before I knew it the meeting was over and I was outside in the cold car park, blinking.
A few days later when I was told I had not won the business I drowned my sorrows with my oldest mate Simon and took him through the whole sad tale. I was convinced that the marketing team were purpose-driven and had seen my little profit speech as incongruous with their belief systems about marketing. When I explained that I was 90% sure I had lost the work because of my financial focus he scoffed and provided a (very long) set of more probable reasons for rejection which started with me being “a tosser”.

I knew he was only trying to make me feel better but his incredulity that you could lose a marketing pitch because you wanted to make money shows how little Simon knew about marketing and how strangely detached from commercial reality our little profession has become in recent years.
Before we go any further, it’s important to make two things very clear. First, I do care about things other than money, but I handle them in what I like to call ‘my life’. It might just be me but I find it entirely possible to go to work for clients and focus on financial things and then, with the rest of the time I get each week, devote myself to more important pursuits like family, animals and occasionally good works.
Second, just because I am driven entirely by making money for companies, I would never do that at the expense of the planet or employees or any other core ethical concern. Again, however, I have found it curiously simple to be profit-driven without finding that a contradiction with principles of decency and responsibility.
I guess what I am trying to say is that, whatever Simon might tell you, I am not a superficial shit. But I really do think the reason marketers are employed is to make money for the companies that employ them. Preferably lots of it. And that’s why I love marketing.
With that long preamble over, let me tell you what I think about the much-debated Heineken ad. I think it’s crap. Absolute crap.
Again, let me provide a couple of caveats to this viewpoint. First, I agree with and support all the viewpoints expressed within the ad, namely: transgender rights, feminism and climate change.
Cindy Tervoort, head of marketing at Heineken UK, speaks very eloquently about the need to “inspire more people to focus on the things that unite us rather than divide us” with this new campaign and again I concur with each and every word. I also think Heineken is a fine beverage and one that I regularly invest a significant amount of my time and money consuming. But I do not see what these important topics and this lovely beer have to do with each other.

Step back from the powerful four-minute Heineken ad for just 30 seconds and ask yourself why Heineken is the featured brand? Couldn’t any other brand pull this off with equal legitimacy? Surely this ad would work just as well with Guinness, Becks, Strongbow, Stella Artois or a host of other beverages.
This is not an ad about Heineken, it’s an ad about people having a beer (with a small b) to talk over their differences. As proof of that consider the ad itself, which has only fleeting images of the Heineken brand. In an ad with more than 1,000 words of dialogue not once do we hear the word Heineken uttered. There are no distinctively Heineken elements, almost no product shots and if you had to estimate an overall figure only about 2% of the whole four-minute mega-production actually features the brand or product at all.
Across the UK this week the Open Your World ad has undoubtedly spawned significant viral chatter. But how much of it revolved around Heineken and how much about “that beer ad with them people in it”. I bet I know the answer.
Perhaps Tervoort and her team at Heineken have very clear data showing that if British beer drinkers associate a brand with transgender rights, environmental protection and feminism they will switch brands. Or, and this is my suspicion, Heineken has joined the increasingly large posse of brands that have stopped seeing marketing as a way to grow awareness, drive preference and ultimately increase sales.
Instead, branding is about beliefs, missions and lofty ideals. Every brand and every newly arrived CMO is not looking for a surge in sales; instead they want to link their brand to a cultural issue faster than you can say ‘purpose’. Travel brands promote marriage equality. Cola brands push for youth protest. Insurance brands celebrate racial equality. And none of it makes any commercial sense.
I think brands have switched from an overt commercial focus to an abstract, belief-based approach for a number of reasons. First marketing is soft and full of people that don’t even understand gross profit, let alone possess the desire to increase it.
Second, most marketers are incredibly embarrassed to admit that they spend 40 hours a week getting people to consume more of something. That’s achingly uncool and sounds appallingly prosaic. Imagine telling someone at a dinner party in W1 that you work very hard to get people to drink more of your beer each week. That would be a nightmare.
But if I can talk about my work to create films that bring people together and reduce hate crimes and environmental destruction even Jane, the woman who works for Médecins Sans Frontières, will approve and perhaps be my friend.
I grow sick and tired of the apparent lack of commercial focus that grips our discipline.
I encourage you to read our profile of Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair’s CMO, this week. I hope he does not mind me saying this but Jacobs is incredibly uncool. He is so uncool he even makes me, usually the least trendy person in Marketing Week, look like Mark Ronson. His interview and whole worldview of marketing is strikingly straightforward and incredibly commercial.
That makes him not only uncool but also very brave and supremely impressive. Typically, when a senior marketer gets a profile in the marketing press they wank on about beliefs, brand mission and their fascination with artificial intelligence. They do that because that’s what everyone else does and because marketing these days is not about profit, it’s about purpose.
I’m sorry to sound cynical but, as I traverse the conference halls and seminar rooms of the world at various marketing functions, I grow sick and tired of the apparent lack of commercial focus that grips our discipline. Of course, the counter argument is that beliefs-based businesses are also more profitable too. Brand purpose and commercial probity are, very handily, one and the same thing, don’t you know?
That was the theme of the recent book ‘Grow’ from the inestimable Jim Stengel, the former head of marketing at P&G. It’s still widely cited in the trendy purpose-driven sessions on marketing around the world. No-one mentions the outstanding work of Richard Shotton, who has taken Stengel’s much trumpeted link between purpose and profit and torn it up into small arse-shaped pieces of paper and sprinkled them all over the floor.
Clearly the Heineken ad has created a dialogue and, hopefully, promoted a series of progressive causes and the whole notion of respect for divergent viewpoints. But what it will not do is help Heineken sell any more beer. The ads certainly won’t do the brand any harm because, unlike Pepsi’s recent beliefs-based campaign, this is a well-made and thoughtful ad (being free of any member of the Kardashian clan also helps).
But just because a campaign does no harm, or perhaps a little good, does not make it a success. There is the important issue of opportunity cost to contend with, and what Heineken could have done with the money. What would have been the outcome had Heineken invested the money, time and other resources they ploughed into world peace and mutual understanding into selling a bit of beer with a strongly branded campaign for Heineken instead?
Somewhere between the commodifying monochrome of physical and mental availability and the achingly cool, belief-based world of ‘inspiring communities to be great’ is a middle path. A path we can call differentiated brand image. Heineken isn’t just a familiar, green beer that you can buy right now. Nor is it an important agent in achieving world harmony. It’s something in between.
And the sooner we get back to that and focus on it, the sooner we can start making money again. Assuming, of course, you’re interested.

Beautiful, when  I grow up I want to be Mark Ritson.
Surprised you didn’t point out this reaction too… https://medium.com/@thedididelgado/the-heineken-ad-is-worse-than-the-pepsi-ad-youre-just-too-stupid-to-know-it-5580e7c40cb1
Having read all that, I need a beer! Time for a Peroni.
I always enjoy reading your articles but this one is something special. Thanks.
“Marketers are employed to make money for their employers” Simple, Straightforward, Provocative. Mark Ritson cuts the crap and once again reminds the wishy washy industry why do they exist. I wish I had a chance to work together with Mark Ritson
Niiice!
Hallelujah for campaigns driving profit! 
Now how do I say that with more brand purpose?…
What a great read.
Mark, great piece and my team have gone an bought me a pair of converse and a box of Kleenex !
I wouldn’t hire this marketer. Super opinionated and confused.
This article assumes you can’t do profit and purpose which I find puzzling. There’s nothing wrong with driving sales while doing good I’ve spent years working for companies who have. I think Heineken did a good job and doing this will drive profit – I consider them to be relevant, aligned to my values and I’m seeing my friends share this ad everywhere.  Of course the associations I make to a brand influence whether I pick-up and purchase it!
I agree that making money should be the primary all marketing activity. However, I disagree that this ad doesn’t make commercial sense. Product-led advertising is becoming increasingly ineffective because consumers won’t engage with content that doesn’t provide value to them. Heineken are increasing brand loyalty and engagement with an ad that speaks directly to their target market. Making money in marketing is no longer about shoving products at your consumers with me me me advertising.
Interesting article but Mark’s central premise is quite wrong. Everyone is talking about the new Heineken ad not “that beer ad with them people in it”.  So unprompted brand recall is through the roof and Heineken have extended their target audience from traditional lager drinkers to, well, everyone. All this at a fraction of the cost of those product focused beer ads Mark likes so much with their exotic locations and celebrity endorsements. Not only was this comparatively cheap to produce but by exploiting social media they have also avoided a hefty a media  bill.  So very clever and so very commercially astute.
Mark’s missed a crucial point here – refusing to ask the question, “What’s the purpose behind purpose-driven marketing?’ Of course marketing is meant to drive sales, all of it. Companies are investing in purpose-driven marketing because consumer expectations have changed. More than ever, people buy from brands that align to their values, and don’t from those that don’t. That means that in order to generate sales, brands need to demonstrate their value. The purpose behind purpose-driven marketing: making money.
Any evidence of consumer expectations changing?
Exactly!
I completely agree with the modern day marketer’s fear of money. 
Recently at a training event when asked what the purpose of our job was… why did we try to understand the customer and change their behaviour… I replied “To make more money.” It was as though I had shot everyone’s fucking dog in front of them, one by one.
However, I disagree with your statement of the advert of the crap ad. Let’s wait till the sales results our out, it may be the want of the marketer to have 99% of the with someone screaming the brand’s name, but the audience doesn’t.
I think they produced great content that gave off the same enjoyable experience as movie trailers. Let the sales be the decider.
Interesting piece from Mark Ritson. It would be great to get a response about how the ad has fared on sales and Purchase Intent before  we conclude if successful or not . Mark’s argument is that brands find a middle point between purpose driven  advertising and commercially driven work.  Does a lot not depend on the values,  insight and mindset of the consumers?
From the perspective of a female occasional beer drinker, I find it refreshing that Heineken has finally reached out to an audience that – in their own words – other beers cannot reach! Or, more precisely, other beers fail to target. Personally, the advert resonates with me as a buyer. It’s not about getting more middle-aged men to drink Heineken or to get in touch with their feminine side. For me – and I think for Heineken – it’s about introducing more women to a beer brand of choice and, inevitably, very much about profit!
From three separate reports, commissioned by three separate research groups:
84% of Americans believe that brands have the power to make the world better
75% of Americans believe that brands should make more of a contribution of wellbeing and quality of life
 75% of Americans believe that brands should take specific actions that both increase profits and improve the economic and social conditions in the community where it operates
We’re not thinking this way because we are soft lefty bed-wetters who have forgotten what profit means, we’re thinking this way because the world has changed.
The good old days aren’t coming back, Mark. You sound angry about that.
It’s called the Theory of Planned Behaviour. What people believe and what they do is not the same, that’s why those statistics are pointless.
“In the United Kingdom, ethical consumerism data show that although most consumers are concerned about environmental or social issues, with 83 percent of consumers intending to act ethically on a regular basis, only 18 percent of people act ethically occasionally, while fewer than 5 percent of consumers show consistent ethical and green purchasing behaviours”. Source: Doane, Deborah. “CSR.” (2005).
In principles I agree but wouldn’t it be useful to support your assertions with some data? Moreover, aren’t we missing the big picture here? Heineken is probably doing tons and tons of hard selling activities all over the world, is it that bad to have some balance with a more purposeful communication that, by the way, is travelling the globe?
I love your writing, Mark, and the way you call out lazy thinking and bandwagon jumping. But I disagree with your perspective on the Heineken campaign.
Heineken’s focus on purpose is commercial, as a response to the social context in which their business operates and which their consumers inhabit. What have they done over the last couple of years? They have looked at that social context and come to two conclusions: one, that they have to address the downside of alcohol in society (irresponsible drinking) head on; and two, that there is an opportunity to market their brand through the upside of alcohol in society (breaking down barriers). And then acted on them with creativity.
In the first case they decided to go beyond compliance and simply tagging ‘please drink responsibly’ onto the end of their ads and tackled the elephant in the room in a style authentic to their brand, with campaigns featuring DJs urging consumers to ‘Dance More, Drink Slow’. This social shield has now given them the licence to pick up a social sword, to celebrate the good that a beer like Heineken can do to bring people together. The Worlds Apart film brings this insight to life in a new and shareable way. The sharing happens at the scale it does precisely because the branding isn’t in your face. Other spots will no doubt be more tightly focused on the product and Heineken marketing needs to be spot on at bar and in store. But it all comes together to grow awareness, drive preference and ultimately increase sales – and this from a brand that grew 3.7% globally last year, with double digit volume growth in the UK.
And sorry you feel you have to separate your work self from your home self (although I don’t believe you). Again, the evidence says people increasingly want to be able to take their true self to work. There’s plenty of research now showing that a higher purpose (i.e. beyond going to work just for the money) creates employee satisfaction and attraction and the support for the #goodworkis campaign ahead of the publication of the Taylor report on Employment Practices in the Modern Economy shows politicians in the UK responding to this as one of the ways of tackling the UK’s issue with productivity.
I should say that I have no commercial interest in Heineken other than drinking it. And do please never stop poking the wasp nests of complacency.
Marketing is disarmingly simple, yet so few of its practitioners (and readers of this column) actually get it:  Identifying, creating and keeping customers profitably.  Every single word in that definition counts and they come in the right order too, leading to the all important profit. Without it we all lose our jobs. So get on with it or choose another profession.
I would probably disagree with Mark regarding this particular ad.
I think it may work for an audience it targets.
“how much of it revolved around Heineken and how much about that beer ad with them people in it? I bet I know the answer.”
You mentioned “Heineken” 25 times in this article. And when people refer to this ad, they’re calling it “the new Heineken ad”. And it doesn’t matter that the product isn’t featured much in the ad, because it will be featured as a hero image on most blog posts and online articles (including yours). Heineken is everywhere.
‘Surely this ad would work just as well with Guinness, Becks, Strongbow, Stella Artois or a host of other beverages.;
But the point is these other brands DIDN’T do it. Heineken DID. There are hundreds of ideas (product-driven ones too) that can be applied to a whole category, but the brand who does it first (and does it well) is the always the winner.
Unless you can prove that this ‘won’t help Heineken sell any more beer’, your argument isn’t the most convincing.
First-mover advantage (if there even is one in this case) does not automatically equate to sustainable competitive advantage. If this campaign is a raging success in terms of increasing brand saliency and sales, another brand will simply align itself with a different belief system or systems held by the same target segment. Heineken will be back at square one and the cycle begins again. Good news for the creative agency, think of all that billable time.
IT’S A DODO.   I said much the same when I first saw this video (it’s not really an ad). Coming from both an ethical marketing specialism and strategic position, I was left scratching my head. What are H trying to do? Or say? This is a social proposition about beer, not H, it could be any brand. Even cider. Or Coke. In fact if it was Coke it’d resonate better. H has no heritage in bringing people with differences together. It’s  a very ordinary beer brand,
Someone at H doesn’t understand beer marketing.
Great PR and social chat but is any of that actually delivering more sales?  Probably not long term.   “Measure the important – don’t make the measurable important”.   Does it reframe the brand… no way.
Rather than just voice my opinion I asked 100 Millennials on one of our research panels what they thought. Not good. No one thought that H was a credible brand when it comes to social issues like this. Bad news, it created a negative response to the brand – seen as gimmicky, trying to exploit an idea… my panel saw straight through it. Then comes the crunch… it doesn’t sell beer. Or reframe the brand. “Pointless.”
This is one of many videos  based on TV  ideas (like that terrible dyslexia sperm bank video).
Now compare this to the new Monoprix ad, Le Film  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt8zcc8oauQ. Beautifully written, simple idea, really engaging, on brand, relevant to Monoprix only… and it got a lot more social media numbers and PR activity. And actually helped increase brand values and sales.
The lesson here is… do a great ad not a gimmick. Great ads perform better. Gimmicks are great if you want to delude yourself with social media numbers and PR coverage, but it’s void.
Good quote, Chris…“Measure the important – don’t make the measurable important”, the digital agency I work with are going to be hearing this alot.
I completely disagree with this article. If this guys is a marketing professor, I believe we should re-think the entire system of our values and education. I think Heineken has a vision and sales with prove it in a long term. This is marketing.
As a freelance marketing consultant,  I recently had a conversation with a potential client who fed back that in my past I was too focused on delivering marketing strategies that impacted the bottom line in terms of revenue and profit. They had asked me to pitch to develop a marketing strategy to enter a new market subsection. They were a FTSE 250 company, but only wanted to follow the pretty pictures and colouring pens definition of marketing. 
I was aghast at the response and felt very sad that marketing is losing its relevance to really driving a company forward. Marketing strategy is about driving a business forward whilst delivering profitability. It is not about chosing a picture or an image.
Whether the Heineken advert, which I had not seen or heard about previously, delivers an upturn in sales is still to be seen.
We are lucky indeed to have someone within the industry who is  willing to hold the profession to account and who is high profile enough to have their voice heard. Keep up the good work Mark, the profession’s reputation depends on it. 
Having recently secured my seat at the top table within the business I work for (the first marketing professional and youngest to do so), I know this came from increasing brand saliency, increasing market share, increasing revenues and growing profits…enabling them to add a seat at the top table, for me to occupy.
If all the major beer brands on the planet formed a co-operative, this would be a great viral ad for the category. It promotes the concept that people of all beliefs can relax and chat over ‘a quiet beer’. And as we know, often a quiet beer ends up becoming quite a session.
I do not disagree that ‘making money’ to drive profit is at the core of the marketer’s remit. BUT ever ask yourself why? I have on many occasions, and how do I reconcile that with wider and societal agendas, and look beyond the silo of my own business function of ‘marketing’?
Ridderstrale and Nordstrum with their book ‘Funky Business’ in 2000 prompted me with their insights to consider the ‘bigger picture’ and my responsibilities within business to the global population, economies, communities, and the natural world. 
For me it’s simple, and constantly asking ‘Why?’ eventually led me to answering our purpose as marketers. Our purpose as marketers is to create prosperity, that’s the end game. Prosperity of the global economy, of communities,  of the planet , of our business, brands, and ourselves. We achieve this through creating ‘relevance’, something that people continue to ‘buy’ and subscribe to – levels of compliance, advocacy, sales, and profit are purely the measures of our success, and mechanisms that help us judge if we’re getting it right, and not the end game in themselves. That’s what differentiates and defines us and our chosen profession of marketing.
Looks like Andy, Julia and I are in the minority, but then again I have a rule of thumb that when the mass support something, it normally means  it is wrong. In this instance Mark, and it happens rarely re your posts, I believe you are truly talking out your arse. 
First and foremost, yes a business is ultimately about making money. But that should be built on a profitable, sustainable, long term business model. Which via a quality product or service together with a positioning and a marketing approach that ensures a brand that completely outflanks the competition. Making it notoriously difficult or even impossible for competitors to replicate or challenge.  
While functional benefits are incredibly important they are all in some way, shape or form ultimately improvable. Therefore open to constant competitor challenge and with it a loss of potential product/service superiority. Thus the only way to truly ensure long term competitive advantage and therefore financial success is to ensure your brand gains a status that transcends functional benefits and develops an incredibly powerful emotional  relationship with the customer that goes beyond normal logic or reason. Namely it achieves Iconic Brand Status.
Sadly to the best of my knowledge an Iconic Brand building approach is rarely if ever taught in marketing courses/MBA’s, no doubt as Tom Peters so eloquently stated why MBA’s don’t teach creativity, because it is bloody difficult. People like yourself therefore can’t adopt a supposed “paint by numbers magic formula” that they can then sell to the gullible. Confirmed by your stance that marketing is just about making money, at least you’re honest in how you position yourself.
To confirm the Marketing Guru’s complete lack of interest. Having successfully re positioned a true Global Iconic Brand, I decided to check with academia. What a surprise just one book written about how some brands achieved this status and why. An exceptional read by Douglas B Holt called How Brands Become Icons.
In it he shows via detailed & painstaking empirical analysis that one or two adverts played THE significant impact on not only achieving this status but the significant volume sales that it resulted in. So sorry to call you out on this one, but the Coca-Cola Teach the World to sing (i.e. Youth protest that you dissed above) and the Mean Joe Green (About Race/Racial Tensions) are two of the ones he proves to be the KEY drivers of Coke performance over the period he analysed.
Next your building up of the Ryanair CMO. I suggest it is actually you who should re read it. Obviously a clever and competent guy, but also wise enough to realise his strength is in value propositions. The only reason people fly Ryanair is price and a virtual monopoly on certain routes. Period! Even Michael O’Leary admitted a while back that they need to improve their approach to customers. Put simply I doubt many customers would remain if someone had the balls and pockets to go head to head on the price and actually provide any kind of decent service to go with it.
Finally Heineken, and the fact that other brands could do the same ad and the lack of branding. Actually if you know the category and core essence of the brands you list none of them would fit comfortably or credibly with that approach. Only Heineken has the brand D.N.A capable of doing it in an authentic and credible way by virtue of it being a lager, its Dutch cosmopolitan heritage and previous off the wall ad campaigns. Also given the negative issues the Alcohol Industry faces. Just an exceptional ad for subtly addressing them all.
As to the branding comment the only thing that for me made any sense was your acceptance of being uncool. Just look at what people especially the more on trend are wearing. Not a massive, in your face logo in sight. Obscene branding is not only  a thing of the past, but shouting at your audience just creates turn-off. Intrigue them, Entertain them, Make them Think and you have a potential friend for life.  
But I guess given you teach and I just do you must be right. Just gonna give Apple, Harley Davidson, Absolut, Marlboro et al a call to say they have been doing it all wrong. Namely they should sod their purpose and just drop their prices, cut the costs and make some bloody money fast. I believe that would fit nicely in your approach, above, to what Marketers should be doing or have you just confused a CMO with a CFO?
Hopefully the next article will be you, back to your exceptional best. Cos never mind the Heineken ad this weeks views, were truly crap.
That a sarcastic comment?  If not please do opine why!
Mark Ritsons article on the Heineken advertising in Marketing Week gives an interesting and reasonable explanation to why agencies no longer are as welcome as business partners in the boardrooms of our clients as we used to be. 
Should it not be the agencies primary task to help our clients to capitalise on their investments and efforts, by contributing to their business with our skills in communication? We should help them to draw potential consumers attention to their offering, so they can stay in business. To help our clients, so consumers can spot the product benefit they have. The benefit that creates a difference to the competitors  brands, so their offering gets to be chosen. To help them communicate so that heir consumers truly can spot and appreciate the value of the marketed product. To create loyalty to the brand marketed.  And thus repeat the purchase of the now preferred brand?
Only then does we as consultants create true commercial value for our clients!
All the above can of course also be achieved with purpose driven marketing.
But most of the time these efforts come out, only as an empty stance. A fake disguise.
One have to be both skilled and cautious in creating a true message that actually also works commercially for the client.  And truly, are not our parents, teachers, politicians, media, artists, and authors more skilled and credible in changing peoples values and frame of mind then commercially driven corporations?
Thanks for a really interesting read. Your blog inspired me to write about the forgotten purpose of marketing in an article for our company. http://www.e-sense.co.uk/brand-strategy-have-we-forgotten-the-fundamental-goal/
Thanks Mark, makes for a thought provoking read. I agree that we still need to focus on the results we can achieve in the marketing profession and ultimately, increased revenue is generally the most important one, however, I do think that consumers behaviour and expectations has led to this change.  Consumers want to know which side the brands are on (look at New Balance and Nordstrom examples in the Trump era) and what they stand for. Consumers also are over being sold to, one way conversations with brands and something being shoved down their throats. That’s not to say marketing shouldn’t focus on making a brand money, but they need to do that in a different way. At least now we may have a better idea of our ROI – and our objective may be to increase the lifetime value of the customer – so we can see the effects of our ‘stories’. You’re right though, I didn’t remember it was Heineken in that ad until I read your article.
L’Oréal Paris’s partnership with The Prince’s Trust aims to help 10,000 young people across the UK become more confident.
With negative consumer perceptions persisting, banks are changing their marketing efforts to take a more purpose-led approach.
American marketers have an exquisite dilemma: should they stand against President Trump’s policies and risk alienating half their market, or stay impartial and weaken their brand values?

Jaywing’s new research reveals that a significant data skills gap is preventing businesses from delivering a personalised customer experience and accurately calculating ROI, says the agency’s marketing practice director, Nick Evans.
Despite nine in 10 marketers (92%) agreeing that data management is a key priority for their business, two-fifths of marketers (40%) believe a lack of analytics and data science skills is preventing them from delivering effective customer relationship management (CRM) strategies, according to new research from Jaywing.
Additionally, three in five respondents (61%) say CRM is the most important marketing skill in today’s climate, and nearly two-thirds (65%) say the availability of data is one of their brand’s greatest strengths.
The report, which captures the views of over 250 managerial to C-level marketers across four industry sectors, also reveals that over half (65%) of marketers do only basic or segmentation-based personalisation of communications, or none at all, with less than a tenth (8%) fully personalising the customer experience across channels.
82% of marketers use only single touchpoint attribution
Brands are also lagging behind when it comes to measuring ROI and attribution across channels, with only one in five (18%) using advanced attribution models. When it comes to measuring marketing effectiveness, nearly six in 10 respondents (59%) agree that accurately attributing value across all channels is vitally important to their organisation, yet less than a fifth (18%) say they use advanced attribution techniques.
The telecommunications industry is the most confident with its data-driven marketing capabilities, with over half of respondents (51%) saying they are ahead or significantly ahead of their competitors. The financial services sector is the least confident (33%), and the retail and travel sectors report equal levels of confidence at 41% each.
Jaywing’s 2017 data-driven marketing report reveals that while the vast majority of marketers understand the positive impact data-driven marketing can have on customer relationships and ROI, they lack the capabilities, knowledge and confidence needed to utilise the abundance of data available to them. With the rapid pace of change in the technological landscape, it is more essential than ever for marketers to ensure their marketing is data-driven, customer-centric, personalised and measurable.
From precise targeting, and accurately attributing value across all channels, to providing insight for the creative aspects of the job, data has the potential to transform businesses. The Government’s digital strategy highlights data as a key catalyst for the development of the UK economy, and businesses need to be prepared to take advantage of the technology and data driving this growth.
As data continues to proliferate, the challenges in managing it do too. Technologies will eventually catch up in terms of data processing, insight and automation, particularly as artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent. However, even with emerging technologies, marketers will still need to be able to plug them in to legacy systems and use analytically derived insight to stay ahead of the game. By adopting best-practice data-driven marketing today and looking for help from experts, brands can effectively plug the data skills gap.

While AI has the potential to replace cognitive functions of the human mind in many business decision-making contexts, it will not replace people completely but enhance their capabilities.
Will machine learning alter radically the way businesses interact with our customers?  Major technology inflection points show the revolution of the age of steam created the industrial revolution by replacing the power of man and beast with the significantly greater power of coal. The age of robotics also removed manufacturing’s dependency on mankind’s opposable thumb. Now the age of artificial intelligence (or machine learning) has the potential to replace cognitive functions of the human mind in many business decision-making contexts.
This webinar covered:
P&G’s new strategy has baffled industry experts, as some say it risks becoming nothing more than a “meaningless mantra”.
The media industry faces a tough challenge as concerns around fake news rise, meaning advertisers associated with those media outlets could run the risk of being tarred by the same brush.
Amazon is hoping to muscle its way into the fashion market with the launch of its own-label fashion brand, but to pose any real threat to the likes of Asos and Boohoo it must shed its utilitarian image.

Here is a round-up of some of the biggest stories over the last week in marketing.
Ever wanted to buy someone a beauty gift but been unsure what to buy them? Well, L’Oréal is hoping to help with the launch of an artificial intelligence-powered Facebook Messenger bot.
Launching in Canada first, the service aims to help consumers find the right beauty box gift for their friends based on a series of questions that define their friend’s beauty profile and help consumers select the right brand and product mix at the right budget. The company says it hopes to launch the service in the UK in early 2018.
The move is part of a wider drive to produce services for its beauty brands and learn more about consumers. In partnership with startup Automat Technologies, the beauty giant is developing a series of beauty services that will launch in the coming months on the Facebook Messenger platform.
The company’s chief digital officer Lubomira Rochet says the focus on Messenger bots is the latest iteration of its “service strategy”. L’Oréal believes conversational marketing and commerce in combination with AI will allow it to have more personalised conversations with its consumers, and in turn increase sales.
She tells Marketing Week: “I believe AI is as big a revolution as the internet itself. It’s going to power more of our interactions with our consumers, be it through advertising, CRM or even ad serving. All those compartments of marketing will be transformed by AI. It’s a great way to get more personalised than we’ve ever been.”
Coca-Cola is axing 1,200 jobs, some of which could be in marketing, as part of wider plans to restructure the business around five “strategic clusters” and re-position as a “consumer-centric total beverage company”.
The job reductions will take place in the second half of 2017 and into 2018 as the company looks to build a “faster and more agile business”. The aim is to reduce complexity, simplify processes and speed up decision-making.
“We are working through redesigning the organisation to be faster and more agile,” said incoming Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey. “The necessary changes will be difficult, but it they will enable us to do fewer things better.”
The cuts are part of a wider restructure at the company as it shifts to what it calls a “category cluster” model. The move will see it focus on five strategic categories – sparkling soft drinks; energy; juice, dairy and plant-based drinks; water, enhanced water and sports drinks; and tea and coffee.
The aim is to ensure Coca-Cola is more disciplined about its investments, with a focus on launching new products through innovation, changing recipes to reduce added sugar and acquiring new brands in categories such as tea and plant-based drinks. For example, Coca-Cola is expanding its premium Smartwater brand into flavoured sparkling waters, while the newly reformulated Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is expanding into more markets.
The hope is this will deliver a further $800m in productivity savings, at least half of which it will reinvest into the company.
Never heard of the phrase ‘Irresistible Superiority’ before? Well soon it could be on the tip of every marketer’s tongue as it is the means by which Procter & Gamble plans to make its marketing more efficient and effective.
The ‘Irresistible Superiority’ programme aims to overhaul the company’s approach to advertising, products, packaging, sampling and in-store promotions. CFO Jon Moeller says its aim is to “raise consumer expectations for the whole category and make it hard to go back to previous competitor products they were using”. It should also reduce the need for promotional spending, he claims.
In terms of what the scheme means for P&G’s marketing, Moeller claims it will raise the bar on the quality of its advertising and in turn create awareness, boost trial and even “define popular culture”.
“We are testing our advertising quality. A campaign must drive growth for a full year, and is judged by a panel. Brands [that currently achieve this] include Always’ Like A Girl and Tide’s ‘If It’s Gotta Be Clean It’s Gotta Be Tide’,” he reveals.
To implement the ‘Irresistible Superiority’ scheme, Moeller says the company is looking to make another $10bn (£7.8bn) in savings this year. Its marketing spend is set to be reduced by $2bn (£1.6bn), which will be achieved by “eliminating media supply waste, reduced agency fees and cutting advertising costs”.
Hopefully that makes it all a bit clearer?
Channel 4 is introducing a new video ad format that allows advertisers to incorporate the first names of viewers into their ads.
Among the launch partners for what it claims is a “groundbreaking” format are Foster’s and 20th Century Fox, with the latter using it for its new horror prequel Alien Covenant.
So how does it all work? Well, any of All 4’s 15 million registered users who watch an Alien Covenant trailer ad while signed in on a web browser will see personalised messages asking them to “Run…” followed by their first name.
Fosters, meanwhile, will share a video with a pint that ends with the slogan “this one’s for you…” followed by the user’s first name.
“Following the success of the multiple brands taking advantage of our Ad 4 You format, we’re now incredibly excited to offer the market something completely ground breaking,” says David Amodio, Channel 4’s digital and creative leader.
“The most attention grabbing word for anyone to hear is without doubt one’s own name, so to be able to offer advertisers the chance to speak directly to our millions of viewers is not just unique, but an immensely powerful marketing tool which adds even more value to All 4’s increasingly personalised experience.”
The UK ad industry is experiencing the “most seismic shift” in its history as digital dominates growth. According to the latest figures from the Advertising Association and Warc, digital formats accounted for 95% of all the new money entering the market. And this trend is only set to continue.
“The trend will continue as ad tech improves and consumers spend more time with their internet-connected devices,” says Warc senior data analyst James McDonald.
Overall, UK ad spend grew to £5.8bn, a 3.9% year-on-year rise, in Q4, making it the highest grossing quarter since the Expenditure Report started in 1982. It also marks an upward trend following flat growth in Q3 in the immediate wake of June’s Brexit referendum.
For 2016 as a whole, ad spend grew 3.7%, reaching £21.4bn and marking the seventh consecutive year of market growth.
Digital formats continued to dominate, with internet ad spend up 13.4% to £10.3bn for the year. Mobile accounted for 99% of that growth, with ad spend for mobile platforms up a whopping 45.4% to £3.9bn. The report predicts mobile advertising spend will slow over the coming years (2017: +30.4% and 2018: +20.8%) as the current boom dies down.
Innovation has become an overused buzzword, according to marketers, but what can brands do to reclaim the term and showcase true innovative ideas and ways of doing business before the word becomes redundant?
Marketers love to predict the death of established ideas, but in reality nothing in marketing ever dies and things change much more slowly than you think.
New research from Mumsnet and Saatchi & Saatchi reveals the brands that are winning the loyalty and trust of modern mothers and what makes them resonate.

We round-up all the latest marketing news you need to know this morning.
Alphabet, the holding company name for Google, has seen shares jump over 5% as it hailed its Q1 numbers as “terrific”.
Revenues jumped from $20.3bn (£15.8bn) to $24.8bn, with revenues rising 22% year on year. Operating income, meanwhile, was $6.6bn, up from $5.3bn in Q1 of 2016.
Larry Page, the CEO of Alphabet, says Google’s decision to create Alphabet as a holding company for Google had ultimately helped investors. “The new structure has helped entrepreneurs build and run companies with the autonomy and speed they need.
“In general we are taking a patient approach to investing our capital. We’re not going to invest if we don’t see great opportunities and we feel like our track record for picking some important efforts long before others is pretty good.”

Facebook says the second iteration of its Messenger app will allow brands to have one-on-one interactions with customers. This, it says, could help resolve problems around dodgy public comments appearing on brand pages on social platforms.
Speaking at a launch in Sydney, Stan Chudnovsky, Facebook’s VP of product for Messenger, explained: “Messenger definitely creates an opportunity where you can go into one-on-one conversation and express whatever you are trying to express. It’s private and contained and assuming brands address that really quick, it will work well.
“It definitely one of the reasons why businesses are flocking to the channel, because it gives them an opportunity to address it before it comes public.”
New features of Messenger 2.0 include a discovery engine, chat extensions, games and enhanced artificial intelligence.

David Dao, the doctor who was infamously dragged off a United Airlines jet earlier this month, has reached a settlement with the airline for an undisclosed amount, according to his lawyers.
The episode had stoked the fears and frustrations of airplane passengers worldwide and became a PR disaster for United. However, on Thursday, both the airline brand and Dao said they hoped now could mark the end of the ordeal.
“[United Airlines CEO Oscar] Munoz said he was going to do the right thing, and he has,” Thomas A. Demetrio, one of Dao’s lawyers, said of Oscar Munoz, United’s chief executive. “In addition, United has taken full responsibility for what happened on Flight 3411, without attempting to blame others, including the City of Chicago. For this acceptance of corporate accountability, United is to be applauded.”
Something tells us  Dao will be flying first class from now on.

Barclays has recorded a strong start to the new year, with its profits more than doubling in the first quarter.
The banking brand said group pre-tax profit rose to £1.68bn in the three months to March 31, up from £793m in the same period last year.
Chief executive Jes Staley, who has recently been offloading unwanted businesses to focus on UK and US operations, said the bank has nearly completed its overhaul.
“This has been another quarter of strong progress towards the completion of the restructuring of Barclays. Group profit before tax more than doubled compared to the first quarter of 2016, and our core businesses continued to perform very well.”

In other banking news, the Royal Bank of Scotland made a profit of £259m in the first three months of 2017, up from a staggering £968m loss in the same period last year.
After stripping out restructuring costs, the core operating business made a profit of £1.3bn, up from £1.02bn. RBS says its cost-cutting plan was ahead of schedule and claims that it has already stripped out 37% of the £750m cuts it proposed for this year.
The three-month profit is the first RBS – which is now majority-owned by the government after being bailed out – has made since Q3 of 2015.

Ikea has launched a playful comeback after luxury fashion brand Balenciaga unveiled its latest tote bag, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Swedish retailer’s infamous blue Frakta shopper.
The two bags are similar in colour, shape and style – even down to the double loop detail on the handle – yet with the designer version priced at $2,150 (£1,365) compared to 40p, Ikea has issued a tongue-in-cheek guide to ensure people can tell the two apart.
Advice includes “Shake it. If it rustles, it’s the real deal” and “Are you able to fold it to the size of a small purse? If the answer is yes, congratulations.”

United Airlines will now offer passengers up to $10,000 (£7,700) to give up their seat if a flight is overbooked as it again looks to step up customer experience.
It is the latest measure taken by the airline to improve repair brand trust following the incident, which saw a 69-year-old passenger be violently removed from one of its planes as the airline needed his seat for a crew member.
The airline says this is just one of “10 substantial changes to how it flies, serves and respects its customers”, which are the result of a “thorough examination of its policies and procedures, and commitment to take action, in the wake of the forced removal of a customer aboard United Express Flight 3411”.
United CEO Oscar Munoz explains: “Every customer deserves to be treated with the highest levels of service and the deepest sense of dignity and respect. Two weeks ago, we failed to meet that standard and we profoundly apologise. However, actions speak louder than words. Today, we are taking concrete, meaningful action to make things right and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.”
He goes on to admit the brand’s “policies got in the way of our values and procedures interfered in doing what’s right” but suggests this is a “turning point for all of us at United and it signals a culture shift toward becoming a better, more customer-focused airline”.
United has been severely criticised for its handling of the situation and Munoz in particular was slammed for its reaction following the incident. Marketing Week columnist Mark Ritson said he made a mockery of the word ‘leadership’.
Marketing Week has taken a closer look at how brands can bounce back from disaster in light of recent events.
Some of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies, including GSK, AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Novartis, are planning to abandon the UK unless the NHS receives an additional £20bn a year.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), which represents these companies, has demanded an increase in health spending from 9.9% to 11% of GDP in its election campaign requests.
ABPI president Lisa Anson, told The Times that the financial squeeze on the NHS threatened the whole of Britain’s £30bn life sciences sector as firms would reconsider working in the UK.

Music streaming service Spotify has acquired Mediachain, a startup that uses blockchain technology to verify ownership of work such as music and images.|
Spotify, which acquired the firm for an undisclosed sum, says: “The Mediachain team will join our New York City offices and help further Spotify’s journey towards a more fair, transparent and rewarding music industry for creators and rights owners.”
The brand adds that this type of movement is “critical to the health of the music industry”.
Mediachain founder Jesse Walden claims in a blog post that the music industry is suffering as it has no central database of music that can be used to ensure royalty payments.
“A music blockchain would be a single place to publish all information about who made what song, without having to trust a third-party organisation,” he says.
Blockchain in its simplest form is a digital ledger that enables organisations to record data in a highly secure way that is both fully verifiable and decentralised. It has the potential to offer marketers a wealth of opportunities, from ad delivery verification to the safe storage of data.

Google has introduced a number of changes to its algorithm to make it harder for people to “game” the system, according to a blog post from the company.
These changes include updates in its algorithm to improve its search ranking, finding easier ways for people to provide direct feedback and offering greater transparency around how search works.
In the blog post, vice-president of engineering Ben Gomes, says: “Today, in a world where tens of thousands of pages are coming online every minute of every day, there are new ways that people try to game the system. The most high profile of these issues is the phenomenon of ‘fake news’, where content on the web has contributed to the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information.
“While this problem is different from issues in the past, our goal remains the same – to provide people with access to relevant information from the most reliable sources available. And while we may not always get it right, we’re making good progress in tackling the problem. But in order to have long-term and impactful changes, more structural changes in search are needed.”
Apple has unveiled the biggest redesigns of its stores in 15 years as it looks to offer educational sessions and hands-on training and turn them into “town squares”. The changes include the launch of ‘Today at Apple’, which offers hands-on training programmes in topics ranging from photo and video to music, coding, art and design. “At the heart of every Apple Store is the desire to educate and inspire the communities we serve,” says Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail. “‘Today at Apple’ is one of the ways we’re evolving our experience to better serve local customers and entrepreneurs. 
“We’re creating a modern-day town square, where everyone is welcome in a space where the best of Apple comes together to connect with one another, discover a new passion, or take their skill to the next level. We think it will be a fun and enlightening experience for everyone who joins.”The redesign will also the introduction of meeting rooms, conference centres and ‘living trees’ in some stores, while in some cases the Genius Bar will be rebranded as the ‘Genius Grove’.
McDonald’s is planning to roll out its delivery service in the UK in June as it looks to grab a share of the fast-growing food delivery market. UK CEO Paul Pomroy tells The Telegraph a trial should be up and running shortly.
“We will start with a delivery service from the right number of sites that gives us scale,” Mr Pomroy explains. “I expect we will take a similar approach to the way we rolled out our app, starting small, learning quickly and scaling up very quickly.”
McDonald’s will not carry out the delivery itself, instead using a third party. That could mean a service such as Uber Eats or Deliveroo is brought on board to offer the service.

The luxury goods giant LVMH is to take full control of Christian Dior in a complex €12bn (£10bn) deal. Under the acquisition, the Arnault family, which owns a controlling stake in LVMH, will buy the 25% of Christian Dior it does not already own. It will then sell the company to LMVH.
LVMH already owns Christian Dior perfumes and beauty. This deal will bring the whole brand, including fashion, under one roof for the first time since the 1960s.
Bernaud Arnault, France’s richest man and CEO of LVMH, says the deal represents an “important milestone” and demonstrates his family’s commitment to LVMH. LVMH is the world’s largest luxury group and was formed through the merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton with champagne and cognac company Moet Hennessey.

The footage was available for 24 hours before Facebook took it down. Other users also uploaded the footage to YouTube, where it has also since been taken down.
Facebook is already reviewing its policies after a spate of objectionable content including a killing in the US and sexual assault were broadcast using Facebook Live.

LinkedIn is rolling out new enhanced targeting capabilities that allow marketers to combine the site’s professional data with their own first-party data.
Available for all LinkedIn advertising products, including sponsored content and sponsored InMail, the Matched Audiences service is made up of three elements – website targeting, account targeting and contact targeting.

Lastly, the contact targeting option allows marketers to upload email addresses directly to LinkedIn, or via platforms like Marketo or Oracle.
LinkedIn reports that during a six month trial involving 370 advertisers and over 2,000 active campaigns, Matched Audiences drove a 30% increase in the click-through rate through website targeting, 32% rise in post-click conversion using account targeting and 37% increase in click-throughs with the contact targeting service.

British luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo has announced it is seeking a buyer.
Valued at £700m, the business is expected to attract serious attention from luxury rivals in China, the Middle East and Russia.
Jimmy Choo’s main shareholder JAB Holdings, which holds a 68% stake in the business, confirmed it is also prepared to offload Swiss premium shoe and handbag brand Bally.
Over the past two years Jimmy Choo has been forced to weather stagnation in the luxury market, seeing its growth slow to 2% in 2016, down from 7% in 2015 and 12% in 2014, according to HSBC figures.
However, news of a possible sale pushed Jimmy Choo’s shares to a record high on 24 April, closing up 10.68% in London.

Peugeot and Citroen have been placed under investigation following allegations their parent company PSA Group cheated diesel emissions tests.
The group, which is 14% owned by the French government, denies fitting its engines with cheating software. However, in 2016 an initial investigation found five PSA Group diesel vehicles emitting significantly higher nitrogen oxide in motorway conditions.
This investigation follows in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal, which culminated in the German car firm paying out £2.2bn in compensation after admitting to fitting 11 million diesel cars with software to manipulate their emissions.
PSA Group is on track to become Europe’s second biggest car marker following its £1.9bn acquisition of the European arm of General Motors in March, which includes Vauxhall in the UK.

Wikipedia’s co-founder Jimmy Wales is to launch a news service combing the work of professional journalists and volunteers in a bid to fight the spread of fake news.
Offering “factual and neutral” articles, the Wikitribune site will be ad free and free to view. Writers will be required to cite sources for each fact and the public will be encouraged to edit articles to maintain accuracy, although pieces can only go live once approved by a staff member or trusted community volunteer.
Speaking to the BBC, Wales argued that the current advertising model had forced most media outlets to “chase clicks”, which was impacting on standards.
The website will instead rely on monthly supporters, who will fund the core paid staff of between 10 and 20 journalists.

Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons is to make its European debut in the UK with the opening of its first outlet in Glasgow next month.
A household name in Canada, Tim Hortons will open on Glasgow’s Argyle Street in May, with further coffee shops planned in other city centre locations nationwide.
Despite being relatively unheard of outside its native Canada, the Tim Hortons chain dominates the home market, claiming eight out of every 10 cups sold across the country.

United Airlines has revealed plans to tie its executive pay structure to customer satisfaction levels as it seeks to rebuild its reputation following a recent PR disaster.
Two weeks ago footage emerged of a passenger being violently dragged off a United plane for refusing to give up his seat on the over-booked flight.
United has faced heavy criticism for its handling of the incident, particularly after its CEO Oscar Munoz failed to clearly apologise and take full responsibility in his first public statement. He described the passenger in question, David Dao, as “disruptive and belligerent” and only later issued a full apology.
In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, United said it was changing its remuneration policy in a bid to ensure no repeat of such incidents.
It said: “United’s management and the board take recent events extremely seriously and are in the process of developing targeted compensation programme design adjustments to ensure that employees’ incentive opportunities for 2017 are directly and meaningfully tied to progress in improving the customer experience.”
Furthermore, the airline said a prior agreement with Munoz to become chairman of the board in 2018 had been cancelled.

The former commercial and marketing director of Woolworths is in talks to bring the brand back to UK high streets.
Tony Page said in an interview with Daily Star Online that he had approached Shop Direct about buying the brand back. The retail chain went into administration in 2008 with debts of £400m, resulting in the closure of 800 stores.
“I am still emotionally attached to it,” he said. “I still think it has got a role in the future.”
Shop Direct ran Woolworths as an online retail site after acquiring the brand but wound it down in 2015 and moved customers to its Very brand.
Page recently left his role as CEO of discount department store Tofs.

US burger brand Five Guys is planning further expansion in Europe, including 20 new restaurant openings in the UK this year, the Telegraph reports.
The chain’s UK chief executive John Eckbert revealed talks are underway with the US parent company about extending its presence beyond the five European countries in which it currently operates: the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal.
“We think Scandinavia, Austria, Switzerland and Italy would be logical places to go,” he said.
Five Guys, which had 59 UK outlets at the end of last year, has also identified a further 75 UK sites that it wants to open over the long-term. The UK business is a joint venture between the US business and the funder of Carphone Warehouse Charles Dunstone.
Mergers and acquisitions in the online retail sector are at a five-year high, according to new research by law firm RPC.
The study shows that eight deals involving online retail businesses closed in 2016 compared to only three in 2012, City AM reports.
Recent deals include Halfords’ £18m acquisition of online bicycle retailer Tredz and the £13m acquisition of World of Books by private equity firm Bridges Venture.
M&A activity is on the rise as traditional retailers seek to grow their online presence and online retailers aim to expand their market share.
RPC partner Karen Hendy said: “The online retail sector is growing at a very fast pace, and we expect M&A activity will continue to rise.”

Economists expect official figures to show a sharp slowdown in economic growth during the first three months of this year.
Growth reached 0.7% in the final quarter of last year but is predicted to fall to 0.4% between January and March 2017, the Guardian reports.
The impact of inflation following the Brexit vote is likely to be a core factor behind the slowdown as disposable incomes take a hit from rising prices.
Real wages fell in February for the first time in two and a half years and consumer confidence has also dipped.
The Office for National Statistics is due to publish its initial GDP figure for the first quarter on Friday (28 April).

Match.com is using Lara, ‘the girlfriend you wish you had’, to surprise and delight its growing number of online daters.
Match.com has launched the first dating bot for Facebook Messenger in the UK, in a move it describes as “pioneering” and hopes will “surprise and delight” its users.
The bot, which is named Lara, helps singles create their dating profile on Match.com through interacting with Facebook Messenger. The idea is that a Facebook user can create a profile on the dating site without having to leave the social media platform.
Lara uses natural language processing techniques and Artificial Intelligence to interact with users in a “seamless manner”. It can analyse up to 50 categories of criteria and looks through people’s Facebook profiles to help maximise their Match.com profile’s success with potential suitors.
The bot launched in France last year and following the UK launch it will be rolled out across the rest of Europe. The underlying aim is to make the process of finding a date much more convenient by allowing users to start a conversation with the virtual dating assistant at any time. ‘Lara’ will ask the user personal details including their age, location and sexual preference, before inviting them to set up a Match.com account. Lara subsequently alerts them whenever she has found a possible date.
Abbie Oguntade, VP Northern European Region at Match.com UK, tells Marketing Week: “Lara is the girlfriend you wish you had or do have. She gives advice and matches you with people you know and will be compatible with.”
In order to stay ahead of competitors such as Plenty of Fish, Match.com says it has to remain surprising.
“Innovation is at the heart of what we do. We need to continue to surprise and delight. But that’s not to say we are blind to what our competitors are doing,” Oguntade adds.
Innovation is not all focused online either, and Oguntade believes this is one of Match.com’s main strengths.
The business has a mobile and desktop platform but it is also focusing on events for singletons wanting to meet in more organic ways. These include things such as art gallery tours, painting classes and ‘match nights’ where people can mingle with other singles.
According to Oguntade, these events will allow the brand to differentiate and avoid being too digitally-focused. She concludes: “We believe we stand for real dating and for people to make authentic connections. We’re happy for people to meet in real life and the events side of our proposition enables us to stand out.”
Please notice:
WorldWide, there are over 5,000 (five thousand) online dating sites
but no one is using the 16PF5 (or similar) to assess personality of its members!
but no one calculates similarity with a quantized pattern comparison method!
but no one can show Compatibility Distribution Curves to each and every of its members!
but no one is scientifically proven! No actual online dating site is “scientifically proven” because no one can prove its matching algorithm can match prospective partners who will have more stable and satisfying relationships (and very low divorce rates) than couples matched by chance, astrological destiny, personal preferences, searching on one’s own, or other technique as the control group in a peer reviewed Scientific Paper for the majority (over 90%) of its members.
but no one can show you a list of compatible persons like this:
( for a prospective male customer / sample but calculated with real values)
“Over 1,000,000 million women database, here is the list of the 12 more compatible with you. Notice that woman#1 is the most compatible with you but she could be more compatible with other men right now.
woman#01 is 95.58476277% compatible
woman#02 is 95.56224356% compatible
woman#03 is 95.52998273% compatible
woman#04 is 94.18354278% compatible
woman#05 is 93.00453871% compatible
woman#06 is 93.00007524% compatible
woman#07 is 92.99738452% compatible
woman#08 is 92.37945551% compatible
woman#09 is 92.29779173% compatible
woman#10 is 92.27114287% compatible
woman#11 is 92.19515551% compatible
woman#12 is 92.12249558% compatible”
The 3 milestone discoveries of the 2001 – 2010 decade for Theories of Romantic Relationships Development are:
I) Several studies showing contraceptive pills users make different mate choices, on average, compared to non-users. “Only short-term but not long-term partner preferences tend to vary with the menstrual cycle”
II) People often report partner preferences that are not compatible with their choices in real life. (Behavioural recommender systems or other system that learns your preferences are useless)
III) What is important in attracting people to one another may not be important in making couples happy. Compatibility is all about a high level on personality similarity between prospective mates for long term mating with commitment.
The key to long-lasting romance: COMPATIBILITY is exactly STRICT PERSONALITY SIMILARITY and not “meet other people with similar interests”.
The Online Dating Industry does not need a 10% improvement, a 50% improvement or a 100% improvement. It does need “a 100 times better improvement”
The only way to revolutionize the Online Dating Industry is using the 16PF5 normative personality test, available in different languages to assess personality of members, or a proprietary test with exactly the same traits of the 16PF5 and expressing compatibility with eight decimals (needs a quantized pattern comparison method, part of pattern recognition by cross-correlation, to calculate similarity between prospective mates.)
High precision in matching algorithms is precisely the key to open the door and leave the infancy of compatibility testing.
Without offering the NORMATIVE 16PF5 (or similar test measuring exactly the 16 personality factors) for serious dating, it will be impossible to innovate and revolutionize the Online Dating Industry
All other proposals are NOISE, of course, and perform as placebo.

The Online Dating Industry needs Innovations, not more bells and whistles!
The Match Group is only a collection of old and obsolete online dating sites: Match, Meetic, Chemistry, OkCupid, LoveScout24 (FriendScout24), OurTime, HowAboutWe, PlentyOfFish and many more and all of them are past their primes, reached operating ceiling and they are in decadence.  
The Match Group is not going to innovate and revolutionize the Online Dating Industry in the next years.

Marketing Week reviews the latest books for marketers.
Philip Larrey
Author Philip Larrey is a Catholic priest and chair of logic at the Vatican University. ‘Connected World’ features his conversations with a wide range of thought leaders such as Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent company Alphabet, and Publicis Groupe CEO Maurice Levy, in which they consider the philosophical implications of the artificial intelligence revolution. Covering areas such as design, data and industrial systems, this is an interesting read for anyone concerned with where business – and the wider world – is heading.
Kim Scott
Endorsed by Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, this book serves as a guide to anyone that wants to sharpen their management skills. Author Kim Scott draws on her experience as a CEO coach in Silicon Valley to argue that “many managers are either obnoxiously aggressive or ruinously empathetic”. Offering practical guidance and actionable lessons, her core message is that it is possible for CEOs to be successful while retaining their humanity.
Andrew Brent
According to Brent, the key to good growth is becoming the dominant “autopilot brand” in your sector. These brands are more likely to be profitable because consumers shopping on autopilot tend to buy at full price and stay loyal with much less marketing effort. The key? Owning “moments of maximum emotional impact”.
Zoe Fraade-Blanar and Aaron M Glazer
Drawing on a diverse range of case studies that include Disney, Ikea and Maker’s Mark whiskey, this book considers how businesses are reshaping their marketing around fan communities. It analyses both the opportunities and the pitfalls of the ‘fan-based’ economy as digital channels allow marketers to build powerful fanbases that can make or break their brands. Essential reading for businesses that want to understand the history and psychology of fan culture.
Jonathan Black
For anyone plotting their next job move, this book offers advice on how to think about and advance your career. Author Jonathan Black, who has been director of the careers service at the University of Oxford for the past eight years, encourages readers to see the “bigger picture” and understand where they are heading not just next year, but in 10 years’ time. Black also offers practical advice on how to network, write applications and perform well in interviews.
Paul Armstrong
This books offers an “evaluation and decision-making framework” for companies that aim to assimilate and optimise the latest technology. Covering everything from blockchain to artificial intelligence, author Paul Armstrong aims to provide a “roadmap” for how businesses can assess and respond to new tech innovations. An important read for marketers that feel overwhelmed by emerging technologies and are searching for strategic guidance.
Derek Thompson
In a world where everyone can see what everyone else is reading, playing and watching, large audiences inevitably cluster around products that find their way into the national consciousness. But how do you achieve this level of popularity? Author Derek Thompson poses the question as he explores what makes a hit.
Dan Croxen-John and Johann van Tonder
Seeking to address the reason why 95% of website visitors don’t buy, this book explores the power of subconscious ‘System 1’ thinking in the decision-making process and how this relates to conversion rate optimisation (CRO).
Coca-Cola has become the latest FMCG brand to appoint a chief growth officer as it looks to tech, innovation and sustainability as the keys for future success.

With the electrifying pace of change and sheer volume of emerging technologies bringing marketers closer to consumers, could 2017 be the best time for marketing?
From creative programmatic and targeted content to emerging technologies like virtual reality and artificial intelligence, the sheer variety of ways to communicate with consumers makes 2017 an exciting time to be in marketing.

Unilever chief marketing and communications officer Keith Weed, however, would go a step further. Speaking at Advertising Week Europe last month, Weed argued that the rapid pace of innovation, coupled with the plethora of methods available to engage with consumers makes 2017 not only exciting, but actually the best time to be a marketer.
“I genuinely believe this is the best time to be in marketing and advertising, because so much is changing and it’s so exciting. I’ve never done a job this long before, but I’m not doing the same job as I was doing seven years ago. It’s radically changed,” he explained.
“To me the exciting thing is there have never been so many ways to engage with people in a two-way conversation. Making sure you’re on top of innovation and working out what’s going on is tremendous. I can’t believe there is anything more exciting just now.”
Exciting yes, challenging definitely. This is the era of fake news, ad fraud and dubious metrics. So far in 2017 high profile advertisers from McDonald’s to L’Oreal have pulled spend from Google and YouTube in fear their adverts might appear next to extremist content.
Consumers are also more engaged with brand messaging then ever. This proved to be the downfall of Pepsi’s latest campaign, which was pulled after a matter of days following a savage social media backlash accusing the drinks giant of co-opting the Black Lives Matter global protest movement.

The “always on” nature of the digital age has given consumers the tools to make their voices heard and have more control over content, notes Sulinna Ong, vice president of artist marketing at music streaming site Deezer.
She believes in 2017 any marketer worth their salt must understand how to utilise all the digital tools at their disposal to create meaningful engagement, which then gives them the opportunity push innovation and creativity up the agenda.
“New technology and the continued rise of social media have dramatically increased demand for authentic and exciting conceptual work, producing creative 360-degree campaigns that may otherwise have been flagged as “too risky” in the past. Now – more than ever before – the appetite for experimentation drives innovation,” says Ong.
This opinion is shared by Creative England marketing manager Rachel Graye, who believes the digital age has broadened marketers’ ability to build relationships with consumers.
“Digital advancements definitely make marketing more exciting. I see it as an advantage to have even more tools at our disposal to get closer to the consumer. Social and influencer marketing, for example, allows us to connect with people in a more meaningful way,” she explains.

“It also allows marketing teams to work more closely as different expertise needs to come together for it to work as a whole. Content marketing forces us to be more creative, which is a challenge and an opportunity to create something new and re-write the rule book – what’s more exciting than that?”
The big debate: Is 2017 the best time to be a marketer? https://t.co/iccFbLgz12
— Marketing Week Mag (@MarketingWeekEd) April 21, 2017

Marketing effectiveness is under the microscope like never before, putting teams under increasing pressure to deliver tightly defined KPIs that directly impact the bottom line.
It is for this reason 2017 brings with it more complexity and accountability, says Dixons Carphone commercial marketing director Jonathan Earle. He argues short-term thinking in the boardroom means marketers are not even given enough time to hold their nerve if the numbers are not coming in.
“It’s got to be immediate response rates and that can also add pressure, because campaigns could be launching new products or services, and it takes time to drive into people’s psyches what you’re doing. Sometimes the ROI has got to be immediate otherwise it’s a failure.”
That being said, Earle believes making marketers accountable for driving real business growth can only be a good thing, as it shows marketing is being seen as a revenue generator not a cost centre.
Now – more than ever before – the appetite for experimentation drives innovation.
“Marketers are accountable now. They don’t just produce TV ads, they’ve got to deliver some hard-nosed numbers on the back of it,” he argues.
“The measurement of marketing ultimately drives a different conversation at the boardroom table and it gives marketing some very clear credibility and targets to hit.”
Marketers in 2017 benefit from access to high quality data, which helps to solidify their business impact, says Ladbrokes Coral chief customer officer Kristof Fahy. He believes that with measureable data at their fingertips marketers can now have robust conversations with their boards, demonstrating how their campaigns benefit the bottom line.
“For me marketing is about generating future cash flow and if you can demonstrate it to the point that everyone believes and buys into the fact your team, activity, plan and approach are delivering hard commercial benefit then actually the conversations become more about what else we can do in this area. That reframing is a very interesting journey to go on,” Fahy adds.
From rich data and insight to real time optimisation, the sheer number of tools at a modern marketer’s disposal can make it easier to lose sight of the objectives than ever before.
Bauer Media managing director of advertising, Abby Carvosso, believes modern day marketers should resist the temptation to follow the latest shiny new thing at the expense of being customer-centric.
“It’s about keeping it simple by understanding the audiences you want to reach. So, while yes there are lots of new things and that’s really exciting for all of us because it keeps the market really fresh, we have to be very careful we don’t follow the shiny new thing,” she says.
“Ultimately for a marketer it is about how do you deliver great engagement, results, action and cultural impact, and sometimes the shiny new thing doesn’t do that.”
Earle agrees that marketers have to understand their target audience better than ever, because now there are so many different opportunities to reach them with content.
“In the same breath, if you don’t reach them with fantastic content this target audience will tell you immediately that you’re wasting their time. So you’ve got to be on top of your game. You can’t just hide behind some loose segmentation, you’ve got to understand who your customers are and what they want,” he adds.

Adapting to evolving trends and emerging platforms is what makes the job so interesting according to Anna Hale, Northern Europe marketing director at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Consumer Healthcare.
One of the most exciting things about being a marketer in 2017 is the insight that can be gathered about consumers in real time, says Hale, which is why marketers need to embrace digital transformation and get to grips with the metrics.
“Some of the challenges are actually a really interesting part of my job, with metrics and measuring effectiveness being a great example,” she adds.
“It’s a fascinating process to work with our agencies and partners to best understand how to measure engagement and it’s exciting because there is no one-size-fits-all approach.”
Creative England’s Rachel Graye agrees that the variety of metrics marketers have at their disposal means in 2017 they can be more agile than ever.
“Quick access to analytics allows us to be more fast-paced – test approaches, react quickly, pivot and thrive – leading to accelerated growth. There is a clear benefit to this versus planning and implementing campaigns over a long time period, while the market is still changing as you go along.”
Like never before, marketers are being asked to do more with less as budgets continue to be squeezed in an era of rising inflation and post-Brexit cuts. However, the constraints are encouraging marketers to push their creative thinking and enhance their skills.
“With budgets under more pressure, yes we are all predominantly expected to deliver more for less, but we are being more creative and using new ways to reach customers,” says Dixons Carphone’s Jonathan Earle.
“Marketers historically didn’t have to be that commercial. They could be very strong brand marketers that created award-winning adverts. Now everyone needs to be very commercial because you’re in front of the chief exec and you have to show how you spent their money.”
Carvosso agrees that while times could be considered challenging this actually offers an opportunity for marketers to shine and forge stronger commercial partnerships.
“It is challenging for marketers because their budgets are being squeezed, but that should breed creativity, because you have to work that budget much harder,” she says.
“I think content and commercial partnerships work much more fluidly now. Some of the partnerships we’ve had were big TV spenders who’ve shifted to radio because it’s a really effective medium, but it doesn’t take up as much of their budget so they can do more creative work off the back of that.”
As a challenger brand in the music streaming space, Deezer’s main currency is creativity says Ong, who emphasises the importance technology has to play in helping marketers deliver on their promises whatever the constraints might be.
“Necessity is the mother of invention, or so the old adage goes, and likewise the reality of having to work within tighter parameters and budgets means the onus is on creativity,” she states.
“My team and I work with some of the biggest names in music, and competition for their time and involvement is fierce. This means that all our artist marketing campaigns need to stand out and differentiate themselves.”
In an era of virtual reality and artificial intelligence, it can be tempting for marketers to feel like there is nothing to learn from the past. That is, as Hale suggests, one of the biggest mistakes a marketer in 2017 can make.
“One of the biggest mistakes marketers can make is to move from campaign to campaign without ever actually taking a pause to look back, evaluate, learn and apply those learnings to future work,” says Hale.
“There is a lot of invaluable knowledge that can be built up and it’s a travesty if that is not passed on through the generations, otherwise the same mistakes just keep repeating themselves.”
In a digital age, where the instant results of real time measurement are everything, it can be easy for marketers to feel the answer to every single marketing question is pay-per-click (PPC) argues Earle.
My worry is that it’s all a bit vanilla, because everything’s got a ROI. Where’s all the excitement?
Instead marketers should not be afraid to look beyond real time optimisation and take inspiration for the way brands approached creating world-class adverts in the 1980s and 1990s.
“I think now one of the biggest issues marketers face is the idea of trying to sell in awareness building, consideration driving activity where the ROI is really hard to measure,” Earle explains.
“My worry is that it’s all a bit vanilla, because everything’s got a ROI. Where’s all the excitement? We didn’t have as many touchpoints in the 1990s as we do now, but driving consideration and awareness can easily get lost when you just want an instant return on investment.”
The combination of traditional and emerging media, the wealth of data insights, and opportunities for personal development makes 2017 the best time for marketing in the opinion of GSK’s Anna Hale.
“Today it’s so exciting to be a marketer because of the opportunity to work with and build major global brands. On top of that, the importance of living and breathing as a brand with social purpose is absolutely critical and provides more fantastic opportunities for marketers as we develop campaigns that deliver on this level,” she adds.
While she does not believe 2017 is necessarily the best time for marketing, Carvosso is excited by the pace of change and the innovations taking place today, despite sounding a note of caution.
“I think it’s a great time [to be in marketing]. Tech advances are helping us and it shows the importance of trusted media brands, as well as of bringing instinct and insight together,” she states.
“We do, however, need to remember what is the core and essence of what we want to do in marketing in terms of engagement and the relationship with customers. That’s a critical thing to hold on to and if we abuse that relationship, that’s where it goes wrong.”
The electrifying pace of change means it is never boring to work in marketing, says Ladbrokes Coral’s Kristof Fahy. In his opinion every year he has worked in the industry has been the best time because there is always something new to explore.
However, for Deezer’s Sulinna Ong 2017 is equally the most exciting and challenging time there has ever been to be marketer. In her opinion the savviest marketers today are merging the latest in digital marketing with traditional methods, boosted by data and insights to give their campaigns added precision.
“Our challenge as marketers is to cut through the noise and lead in a world that’s driven by technology,” says Ong. “Concurrently the demand for pushing boundaries and being disruptive has never been stronger, giving us a creative freedom I don’t believe we’ve seen before in any other time.”

Interesting this has “Increasing Accountability” as a section header. More and more of us plan to invest in social media, but there is little focus,. let alone knowledge, about its value, let lone return. 
So much for instinct and insight working together, 
Yet, 2017 is a proverbial wank-fest of definitely not predictable cyclical-looking trends, and of-the-moment nonsensical terms which definitely won’t disappear by this time next year, honest.  Remember “What brands can all learn from Pokemon Go?” Yeah, me neither.

Digital media are fast becoming dominant in brand marketing but can they deliver long-term effectiveness as well as short-term results, reaching both the masses and targeted audiences?
The amount of data available to marketers using digital channels is immense. But while digital is lauded for its ability to allow brands to reach the right consumer, at the right time, in the right environment, the question remains whether it is an effective medium for mass marketing.
Digital channels are often accused of making marketers think too narrowly in their activity, meaning they sacrifice reach and long-term growth for narrow, short-term metrics.
Brands have become more acutely aware of this trade-off since the publication of Byron Sharp’s book ‘How Brands Grow’, which suggests marketers should replace targeting with “sophisticated mass marketing”.
Last year, Procter & Gamble’s chief brand officer Marc Pritchard confirmed the company was moving away from targeted Facebook advertising after calling its approach too “targeted and narrow”. P&G, however, insisted it was not planning to cut its total investment in Facebook and would continue to use targeted ads for some products, such as selling nappies to expectant parents.
Meanwhile, Mars’s former global CMO Bruce McColl has asserted that he is “not a great believer in targeting”, adding that the company’s target is “about seven billion people sitting on this planet”. Speaking at the Advertising Research Foundation’s conference last year, he said: “Our task is to reach as many people as we can; to get them to notice us and remember us; to nudge them; and, hopefully, get them to buy us once more this year.”
Both statements would indicate that the brands are following Sharp’s recommendation to “continuously reach all buyers of the category” and move away from standard segmentation and targeting if they want to grow their business. It is often not digital that springs to mind when looking to reach people at scale.

Aviva’s brand communication and marketing director Pete Markey says there is a “sweet spot” of people the insurer wants to reach, but argues that if a business becomes too narrow, it will not be visible to customers.
Instead, he suggests the best segmentation is one the entire business can use that goes beyond targeting to focus on the experience the brand wants to give the audience.
“I see a role for broader segmentation, but I also see a role for smaller, microtargeting. It’s not one at the expense of another,” says Markey. “I’ve seen segmentation that works and doesn’t work. The danger is if it becomes the exclusive property of the marketing team, the rest of the business isn’t that interested. If you can’t use segmentation, it very quickly loses its credibility.”
IPA director of marketing strategy Janet Hull believes the natural progression is towards personalisation, driven by the rise in data generated by digital and social media.
“The insight you get from data you can then expand on, starting with the individual. That approach gives you more nuance, so you can serve creative work that works and improve the quality of advertising online and offline,” she adds.
Brands can use targeted marketing communications to deliver personalisation, which drives increased engagement and conversion rates, according to the IPA’s Social Works Personalisation guide published in March. However, the report acknowledges that strategies designed to increase brand relevance should always be balanced with campaigns that drive reach through mass marketing.
When The Economist wanted to increase brand awareness and drive subscriptions, it targeted a group of people labelled the “globally curious”, modelled on its database of existing subscribers. Despite being targeted, this was by no means a niche group, with The Economist estimating the number of globally curious people was close to 73 million.
“If a brand is to solve an awareness challenge, then reach is important, but we don’t conduct reach campaigns just for the sake of it. There will always be a longer-term goal and everything we do has a KPI to it,” explains Mark Beard, senior vice-president of digital media and content strategy at The Economist.

“We need to make sure everything we do is driving some kind of interaction and [can] help us convert more people to subscribers,” says Beard
This was the approach taken by The Economist for its digital marketing campaign ‘Raising Eyebrows and Subscriptions’. The aim was to provoke the audience by serving them content they couldn’t ignore in order to demonstrate the relevance of The Economist’s journalism. The idea was to give people “their own epiphany” by offering content that compelled them to subscribe.
Part of this strategy involved placing ad units on articles the globally curious target group were already reading, which showed them a hopefully more interesting article authored by The Economist team.
The success of the campaign was highly measurable, generating 5.2 million clicks and 64,000 new subscribers worth £51.7m in lifetime revenue. The campaign, which won a Gold Cannes Lion last year, continues to run and has evolved to include an element of video.
The discussion is moving beyond reach to ‘attentive reach’, which takes into consideration more than just viewability.
“We don’t really run campaigns in our digital department,” says Beard. “We don’t talk about campaigns, we talk about always-on activities and initiatives. With digital you can be short term, but it is possible to be long term too.”
Mondelez International’s digital and social media manager Pollyanna Ward is an advocate of operating an always-on digital strategy, which feeds into a wider campaign across TV, experiential and outdoor.
“For us in FMCG, we need to reach everyone. There’s no one specific audience. For us, the priority is always going to be reach. So you might have an always-on strategy where you’re planning things for an entire year and you might continuously pump out a brand message on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube.
“You can change that in real time and push out core brand messages at times when it’s relevant, meaning you don’t need to do continuous targeting all year round. Then shorter-term digital strategies are key with the big activations to get people buzzing and when they’re aligned with your PR, experiential and TV you get results a lot quicker.”
Concerns continue to persist over how effectiveness should be measured in the digital age. Facebook fuelled the fire last year after revealing a number of errors in the way it measures audiences, admitting it overstated for how long users watch videos on its site by up to 80%.
READ MORE: Mark Ritson – Facebook should hang its head in shame for measurement errors
This, in part, led P&G’s Pritchard to launch a searing assessment of the industry’s “murky” supply chain in January, blaming the “antiquated media buying and selling system” for its inability to cope with the technological revolution.
Last month, meanwhile, WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell urged Facebook and Google to step up and “take responsibility” for measurement errors and ad fraud, arguing the major digital players are “clearly not doing enough”.
Yet despite these concerns Facebook’s revenues continue to soar, rising 51% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $8.8bn (£6.9bn). So as brands appear unlikely to move ad spend away from the platform, it is more important than ever to find new effectiveness metrics.
Dixons Carphone’s commercial marketing director Jonathan Earle suggests one method is to add bespoke codes to track customers who purchase as a result of seeing an advert on Facebook or YouTube.
The discussion is moving beyond reach to ‘attentive reach’, which takes into consideration more than just viewability.
However, if marketers want to drive sales, he argues there are digital channels that deliver much stronger results than social media.
“If the metric is to get as many people thinking about us as possible, then social has a clear role to play, but if you want to drive sales, that’s where pay-per-click comes in,” he explains.
“If I had £100 to spend on a marketing campaign and my sole aim was to drive sales, I would just use social to drive awareness, consideration and conversation as there are better channels to drive the final sale.”
Earle argues that pay-per-click (PPC) is the most measurable marketing channel, serving content to customers that matches their organic online search terms. The team can then track that traffic from the click-throughs all the way to conversion and order value. The PPC activity takes between seven to 10 days to maximise, says Earle, who advises marketers to be clear upfront about what it is they want to deliver.
At Google and YouTube, the response to measurement issues is to offer free tools like AdWords and brand lift surveys, as well as third-party viewability verification.
“The discussion is moving beyond reach to ‘attentive reach’, which takes into consideration more than just viewability,” explains Google brand planning industry lead Gerald Breatnach.
“We tend to think of this in terms of ‘WAVE’ – measuring watch time, audibility, viewability and engagement. Marketers not only need to know how many views a campaign has generated, but the unique reach of the campaign and the average watch time. Ultimately, these campaign metrics need to link to sales results,” he says.

Understanding that success looks different on each channel is crucial to accurately measuring effectiveness and in the digital landscape there is no one-size-fits-all approach.
“If I wanted to make an impact with the younger generation,  I would be looking to see how effective Snapchat is at delivering impressions, but when it comes to different channels I would be looking at the view-through rate to see if we have made an impact,” Ward explains.
“If the view-through rate shows they only watched 10 seconds of our 30-second ad, then did we land our product message in that time? Or have they watched a pretty piece of creative, but we’ve done nothing for brand linkage and brand awareness?”
Reach is important, but on its own it isn’t good enough.
Google’s Breatnach agrees it is a mistake to think all digital channels work in the same way or only equate to “tightly targeted” performance marketing.“Online video advertising on YouTube, for example, has the potential to offer attentive reach and deliver long-term brand results,” he explains.
“Search is naturally targeted to audiences further down the purchase funnel. Programmatic has the potential to deliver both mass reach and sophisticated targeting.”
Peugeot’s marketing director Mark Pickles appreciates that to measure digital effectiveness you need absolute clarity about what you want to achieve.
“For a new product, the primary focus is likely to be on reaching mass awareness within the identified customer segments. Whereas with an established product, often the place for digital is to convert existing awareness into some form of action – what I call a ‘nudge’ – which pushes the consumer a little closer to us,” he says.
“Clearly, the metrics for these two campaigns will be different and so will the media optimisation rules. Setting a campaign that is optimised to generate hard sales leads is likely to fail when it comes to reaching enough eyeballs, particularly as our programmatic algorithms quickly seek out targeted prospects.”
The Peugeot marketing team generally sets several secondary objectives and a primary objective, which Pickles emphasises it is important to be realistic about.
He says: “If I was to set the primary objective of a campaign action as ‘how many sales can I directly attribute?’, I’m likely to under-value the secondary deliverables. A campaign might sell a few cars, but generate sufficient awareness and action that translates to results outside the campaign metrics.”
Hull argues that it is fundamental for marketers to understand the difference between what they are doing for the long term and their brand activation objectives.
“You also need to make sure you’re getting the right investment for the KPIs that you’re setting, because there’s no point setting KPIs and then not putting the right amount of money behind them,” she explains.
“Some of the clients have been saying that they have been under spending relative to the promise they have made on what they’re going to deliver. We also need to get the languages to match up. New media brings a new vocabulary and new forms of measurement, but you have got to know how they relate to the other forms of measurement.”
Armed with the ability to optimise 24 hours a day, seven days a week marketers now have the opportunity to tweak campaigns in real time.
Aviva uses econometrics and attribution to measure effectiveness, combined with its brand impact index, which investigates brand health. Markey argues that marketers cannot afford to ignore the opportunity to optimise.
“The idea that as a marketer you can be asleep at the wheel is so wrong. To push a campaign out and hope it works or do campaign evaluation at the end would be insane, lazy, suicidal,” he says.
“For me, when you start any activity you need to know how you’re going to measure it throughout and consistently go back, using neuroscience to refine activity.”
However, when exploring real-time optimisation marketers must resist the temptation to make knee-jerk decisions, which take them away from their original KPIs.
“When you’re spending money on a campaign that’s aimed at trading and selling, and you say ‘I want to sell 20 of this thing and I only sold three’, you can pull that money and put it somewhere else,” says Markey.
“When you’re trying something new, it’s much harder and you have to hold your nerve. You need the levers, but you need to know when to pull them. There are many examples of campaigns that are a slow burn. There is an expectation that when the new campaign has launched, sales will double tomorrow, and we all know that’s rarely the case.”
It is not what you track, but what you choose not to track that’s important.
The Economist’s Mark Beard agrees that it is very easy for marketers to fall into the trap of tracking everything on a digital campaign just because they can.
“It is not what you track, but what you choose not to track that’s important. We track two things predominantly – the number of prospects we’re bringing in and how many subscribers we’re generating as a result of those prospects,” he says.
“There are many other KPIs we could have reviewed as the campaign went along but the danger these days where much of marketing is done via machines, is if you give the machine the wrong KPIs to optimise you won’t get the results you want.”
This is where human input plays a vital role, says Beard, ensuring the right KPI is chosen at the outset and setting up the artificial intelligence to operate at its optimum.
In a world where optimisation can happen at the touch of button, it is more crucial than ever for marketers to set out with a clear appreciation of their KPIs and then design their digital activity to deliver as part of a holistic strategy.

The fashion brand’s head of marketing analytics says brands should not prioritise targeting as a strategy and ignore reach.
New research show UK marketers are struggling to reach their desired audiences online, with just 47% of campaigns seen by their target audience.
Procter & Gamble has admitted its targeting went “too narrow” and that mass reach remains important as it looks to stay front of consumers’ minds.
Top marketers share their insight on maximising effectiveness and debate whether the industry needs a new toolbox for the digital age.

In the latest instalment in our video series exploring new technology, Marketing Week looks at how and why brands are using artificial intelligence to calculate the return on investment on sports sponsorship.
Calculating return on investment is a vital part of the marketing profession. As the role becomes increasingly about the numbers and the creative, marketers are looking for ways to show the value of their advertising spend.
In this video we look at the latest technology from GumGum Sports, which calculates the ROI of sports sponsorship and advertising using machine learning and artificial intelligence. Chief executive, Ophir Tanz talks through how the technology works and why brands are using it.

Samsung has unveiled its first new smartphone since the Note 7 fire debacle as it looks to bounce back and prove it still has what it takes to lead the market.
Samsung has unveiled its first new smartphones since the Note 7 disaster, as it looks to prove the quality, safety and craftmanship of its devices.
Launching on 28 April, the new Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature an ‘infinity display’ screen that runs the full width of the device, an invisible home button, the ability to unlock your phone via facial recognition technology and even an earphone port. The latter is a dig at rival Apple, which controversially decided to get rid of the port and place its bets on wireless earphones for the iPhone 7.
The Galaxy S8 marks the first major launch since last year’s faulty Samsung Note 7 phone, which was subject to a worldwide recall after faults caused it to catch on fire and in some cases explode. And there’s no doubt the scandal caused major problems for Samsung.
READ MORE: Samsung’s profits have recovered but has the brand?
According to IDC, Samsung shipped 77 million smartphones globally in the fourth quarter of 2016. This represented a 7% decline on the previous year, when it shipped 83m units, and is slower sales growth than Apple recorded in the fourth quarter. Samsung also saw its total mobile handset sales fall 3% to 311.4m for 2016. But with a 21% market share, it still leads the sector.
Samsung’s strategy in cleaning up the Note 7 controversy looks to have worked. Last year, it took out full page newspaper ads apologising for the debacle while the decision to ramp up prices for its components, such as displays and chips, meant the fourth quarter was actually one of Samsung’s most profitable quarters ever. It also managed to persuade some Note7 users to trade-in for a Galaxy S7 Edge, which softened the blow slightly.
And over the last 26 weeks, which cover when the Note 7 scandal emerged to now, Samsung’s index score – a balance of consumer perceptions of a brand’s quality, buzz, value, reputation and satisfaction – rose 1.8 points, according to YouGov BrandIndex. This meant it stayed top of a list of the UK’s 35 biggest mobile phone brands. However, even if it is still growing this was a much slower rate of growth than Apple, which benefitted from its rival’s woes and grew its index score by a more impressive 6.3 points over the same period.
Speaking to Marketing Week, Ben Stanton, an analyst at Canalys, says the Samsung brand “isn’t out of the woods yet” even if it is “on the up.”
He says: “Timing is crucial, and consumers have short memories. This is because smartphone refresh cycles are very short compared with products like tablets and PCs. Samsung has two major launch events every year. It is very easy for them to quickly shift consumer focus onto the next big thing.”
However, he thinks Samsung’s decision to relaunch refurbished Note 7 devices is an error at a time when the company is focused on its new smartphones.
“Samsung has made a major mistake by stating its intention to refurbish Note 7 devices so close to its Galaxy S8 launch. This is a misstep, which has detracted attention from Galaxy S8 and brought negative PR back to the surface at a critical time. Its brand isn’t out of the woods yet,” he explains.
Stanton says Samsung has thrown everything it has into the Galaxy S8 launch and is prioritising hardware in a bid to fightback against “aggressive” Chinese vendors such as Huawei and Oppo.
He explains: “The stand out feature of Galaxy S8 is design – make no mistake. Its rounded-edge display is beautiful. But it also shows that design aesthetic is the most important factor for smartphones now. For Samsung, it has become even more important than full-screen content delivery.”
The new Galaxy smartphones also feature Bixby, Samsung’s new artificial intelligence assistant tool and something it claims is far more advanced than the likes of Apple’s Siri or Microsoft’s Cortana. Bixby will deeply integrate itself within everyday functions such as recommending restaurants and possesses a “contextual understanding” of the world. Yet IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo isn’t convinced by it.
He concludes: “The race is on to have the best digital assistant, since that will drive hardware sales. But in the past, some of Samsung’s features have looked great in presentations, but when you use them on a daily basis they have not been as good.”
Great article. Personally, I am a mobile phone fanatic and have already gotten the chance to check out the  S8 and S8+ devices in person. I am a huge fan of Samsung and believe that they produce the best smartphones in the world, so it was disheartening to see the failure of their Note 7 device. As I traveled around the country over winter break, each and every airport I visited had signs posted saying that Samsung Galaxy Note 7 are not allowed in the airport or on the airplanes. The flight attendants announced this again on each leg of my flight. They say that all press is good press but this could not have been good for Samsung. I agree that Samsung has made several substantial efforts to  make amends including their formal apology and replacing the devices with S7 Edge devices, but one of their more recent ones, went unmentioned. Samsung recently released a thirty-second long advertisement about their new batteries and strict security and safety checks that each device must pass. I believe that this is an important step for Samsung to reassure its consumers that their new devices will not end in the same fiery disaster (pun intended) that the Note 7 series did. Personally, I am considering picking up a S8+, but am going to wait a month or two to ensure that there are not any widespread problems similar to before. As mentioned in the article, time will be Samsung’s best friend. If the S8 and S8+ do not have problems, I think consumers will forget all about the Note 7 debacle and focus on the beautifully designed devices with state of the art technology.
Mobile World Congress: Samsung acknowledged the difficulties it faced last year after its flagship phone problems in a noticeably more low key event that saw the brand reveal plans for a UK trial of its 5G network as it strives to deliver on commitments to the internet of things and connected devices.
Samsung has ended production of the device after a recall meant to deal with safety issues saw replacement phones also catching fire.
Samsung is hoping its marquee Olympics ad ‘The Anthem’ can break down geographic barriers as it pushes forward with its aim to adopt a ‘human focus’ in its marketing.

There can be no justification for advertising funding abhorrent organisations, even if marketers were hunting for the lowest possible price for their programmatic advertising.
Two months ago most marketers would have struggled to explain what ‘brand safety’ was, let alone incorporate it into their communications planning. But barely seven weeks later, it has risen from relative anonymity to the very top of the marketing totem pole for almost every major brand on the planet. 
Like me, you were probably vaguely aware of the original article in The Times that claimed ‘Big brands fund terror through online adverts’ and the subsequent response, particularly of Jaguar Land Rover, which was the first major advertiser to pull all their digital advertising in the UK as a result of brand safety concerns. But things quietened down and the issue appeared to fade from the marketing agenda. 
READ MORE: Google under fire as brands pull advertising and ad industry demands action
Then, less than two weeks ago, we were confronted with a growing array of bizarrely juxtaposed advertising relationships. It’s hard to know which media placement made the least sense. Was it the idea that Marie Curie was funding and appearing alongside a Neo-Nazi group? Maybe it was the Guardian’s online membership drive being featured on a video for bearded jihadi warriors. Or perhaps it was an ad for Scottish tourism appearing alongside videos for white supremacy. Time and again the most unimpeachable, familiar brands suddenly became associated with unmentionable hate groups. 
But what has proven more disarming is the response from most of the marketing community and the fallout from the current brand safety crisis. Increasingly, living in a special digital world detached from consumer reality and unaccustomed to any form of critical assessment, many digital marketers took to social media to point out that this was as much the fault of advertisers as it was the poor unfortunates at Google. 
Daniel Gilbert, the CEO of Brainlabs, typified the response with an article for Campaign that opened with: “The recent blame game where Google is the ‘big baddie’ is pure deflection in an attempt to hide the real truth – that media agencies and advertisers don’t understand how to run effective ad campaigns on Google’s platform”.
Wayne Blodwell – the CEO of The Programmatic Advisory – was equally dismissive of Google’s culpability. “Advertisers should stop pointing all of the blame at YouTube and become more accountable,” he concluded.
Blaming the customer for brand safety issues isn’t just stupid, it runs directly against one of the core tenets of marketing. While it’s fair to point out that many of the clients affected were clearly hunting for the lowest possible CPM and therefore not on top of their game, it’s unfair to suggest that this somehow justified their advertising appearing in such intolerable media contexts and funding such abhorrent organisations.
Other, equally dismissive responses to the brand safety scandal acknowledged that the issue was a problem but queried whether it was anything other than a tiny, negligible issue for advertisers. Google EMEA boss Matt Brittin initially tried this line of argument at the Advertising Week Europe conference in London 10 days ago. 
Brittin apologised for the brand safety issues that Google had created but then observed: “In general I’ve found that it has been a handful of impressions and pennies not pounds.”
It was a line repeated by several other marketers last week with various estimates reducing the proportion of unsafe material to fractions of a decimal point. That jars significantly with independent analysis by Integral Ad Science (IAS), which estimates that around 8% of all digital display advertising and 11% of digital video had the potential for brand risk in H1 2016.
That risk (as shown above) is variously made up of content associated with pornography, hate speech, violence and illegal drug consumption. If you listen to the Google apologists the odds of an adverse incident of brand risk appear about the same as a lightning strike. If you believe the IAS report it is more akin to Russian Roulette, and you play the game every time your ad is served. Probably somewhere between these two extremes lies the true proportion, but that’s enough risk to keep even the most cock-sure brand manager awake at night.
Other responses to the brand safety saga pointed to a dark conspiracy by traditional media outlets, and particularly the news media, to exaggerate the crisis in a nefarious attempt to damage Google’s advertising credentials and rescue their own flagging revenues. With headlines like the Daily Mail’s ‘Google – The Terrorist’s Friend’, it was clear many tabloid newspapers were going in egregiously hard last week.
It’s a matter of perspective whether this negative coverage was an explicit attempt by the news media to undermine their now dominant digital rivals or the stirring of sleeping giants that have sat on their respective hands for too long and allowed digital media to play fast and loose with the truth at their own commercial expense.
Whichever it is, Google had become accustomed to winning massive market share with barely a whimper from its media rivals. This sudden eruption of hostilities, the vehemence of the attacks and the apparent damage done to both its revenue stream and share price must have taken the search giant by surprise. One of the few disadvantages of being part of a duopoly is that your competitive zeal and ability to fight back gradually dull. Perhaps we saw some of that duopolistic lethargy on display last week as various Google executives appeared genuinely bemused at the crisis that unfolded around them.
Brand safety is not an excuse to beat up Google or a tiny issue exaggerated by media rivals; it’s a massively unacceptable contradiction to corporate social responsibility and the whole notion of purpose-led brand management.
Despite the naysayers, this is clearly not a crisis created by traditional media or one that has been exaggerated to enable clients to get better terms from Google. Cynics might question the veracity of brand safety but the issue is a genuine one and not a gambit being used to restore balance to the media playing field. Advertisers really are paranoid about this kind of stuff. To understand why, indulge me with a story from my dim and distant past. 
I once worked with the partner responsible for marketing at a large consulting firm. We had flown to Miami for a training programme and as we walked through the airport he spied a homeless man carrying his possessions around in a large paper bag. Without hesitation, the consultant strode purposefully across the airport and offered the man a crisp $20 note. 
An exchange took place and seconds later the homeless man was on his way with a broad, toothless smile plastered across his face and his possessions under his arm. The consultant was back at my side clutching the paper bag which, I realised, bore the name of his firm in bold blue letters across both sides. Far from a sudden injection of humanity or pathos, the consultant had been appalled at the damage that this branded bag might have on his firm’s reputation and acted accordingly. 
At the time, I found the exchange bizarre and curiously distasteful. But it’s an accurate reflection of how most advertisers, especially those in direct control of a brand, feel about any inconsistencies or contradictions in their brand’s public presentation. If marketers are content to spend millions to protect the reputation of their brands and promote their social responsibilities to all and sundry they are also, by the same logic, likely to go to equally extreme lengths to avoid any inappropriate associations or connections in the way their brand appears. 
Brand safety is not an excuse to beat up Google or a tiny issue that has been exaggerated by media rivals; it’s a massively unacceptable contradiction to corporate social responsibility and the whole notion of purpose-led brand management. The fact that the media will now shine a light on any and all incidences of brand safety certainly exacerbates the issue, but it did not create the crisis in the first place.
Ignoring the excuses then, what does the brand safety saga tell us about advertising in 2017? First, it confirms the fact that despite the shiny golden promises of programmatic it really does represent a black box of turds and spiders for many clients.
Despite repeated claims from independent sources that as much as 70% of all money invested in programmatic is going to various ticket punching agency commissions and not to media platforms. Despite estimates that put the proportion of bots being served ads in programmatic somewhere between 3% and 37%. Despite clearly not having a fucking clue where their advertising is going or who their marketing budgets are funding via programmatic media buying. Advertisers continue to invest more and more into programmatic in this country. The £2.7bn invested through programmatic in 2016 represented an increase of 44% over the previous year.
Secondly, it provides further evidence, if any were needed, that advertisers at even the biggest brands don’t actually know what their media money is doing. Things have become too complex, too fluid and too multi-dimensional for even the biggest brand managers to control. 
This was apparent from the ANA report last year in which clients were portrayed as naïve, almost child-like figures who were wholly unaware of the “pervasive” transparency issues that surrounded them at any turn. It also emerged from the disarming honesty of Marc Pritchard, the chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble. He openly admitted that his agency had received rebated media as a result of making media purchases on his behalf but without his approval or awareness. And when he challenged his agency he was also unaware that the contract he had signed with them sanctioned such activity. 
READ MORE: P&G’s Marc Pritchard has made the biggest marketing speech for 20 years
That same lack of knowledge and control was embarrassingly evident in the proud claims of L’Oréal  UK CMO Hugh Pile. He claimed to be “very clear on where our media money was going” in an interview in The Drum on 7 March. But a week later the company was “horrified” and “unaware” that its latest campaign featuring Dame Helen Mirren and the Prince’s Trust featured alongside the message that gay people “were not born that way, but they will burn that way” from hate preacher Steven Anderson. 
If the likes of P&G and L’Oréal  are finding themselves out of step and out of their depth in the brave new world of digital media and programmatic, imagine the situation further down the big brand pecking order.
The brochures of the brave new world of digital media proclaim real-time efficiencies, artificial intelligence and the ability to engage with consumers globally. But the reality that is emerging from the transparency issue, programmatic murkiness and the growing spectre of brand risk is about as far from this idealistic panacea as its possible to imagine. 
Digital marketers might contend that these are understandable issues for a new industry barely a decade in the making. But with 58% of UK advertising spend now devoted to digital media it seems a little late to be putting everything down to growing pains.
I can totally see why brands object to their adverts appearing alongsize videos from genuinely “abhorrent organisations”, such as ISIS, neo-nazis or antifa.  Google should allow brands to block them, though just taking the videos down seems simpler. But the number of these videos is a tiny percentage and the chance is seeing an offensive video accidentally must be miniscule . I’ve never done so. So it seems fake news more than a problem. 
The real issue is that there are lots of videos from non-mainstream political publishers –  social justice warriors of the left and right (they *all* hate that term!) – who have outspoken and unusual views on life. I find them interesting, but from the comments, it’s clear that their videos annoy and get considered “abhorrent” by people who disagree politically, and I worry that the current furore is actually targeting these. 
So the real danger is that maybe  non-mainstream politics is about to lose access to advertising revenue, especially if this happens in a non-balanced way (e.g. lefties loose funding while righties don’t, or vice-versa).
it does appear that their advertising is what keeps the CEOs & CMOs awake all night, given how stringent they are in demanding no ad is released without their approval or not adhering to their guidelines.
Obviously this is therefore an equally important larger issue as Prof. Ritson argues. Within conventional media advertising in a pornographic tabloid is different from advertising in the  Times as most CMOs know  even though the readership is the converse of the rates charged.
& If instead the marketing community is being blamed for this lapse (!!!) they should wrest back control & find a new model or medium (conventional mass media, or approaching reputable online publishers directly as traditionally was done by their agencies)
… programmatic anyone?
Hi Pete,
It’s not just affecting people who watch the videos though is it. What I (speaking as either a consumer or a marketer) feel angry about is that the brands whose advertising appears alongside these videos are effectively generating ad revenue for organisations such as ISIS. So you’re in a situation where consumer brand X is helping to fund ISIS. There can be no excuses for allowing that to happen
Whichever way you look at it s key role of Marketing is to get their messages to their target market. Marketing people therefore need to be very precise about who their targets are and who they are not.  This type of clear specification is how businesses buy the other services they need.  The customer (Marketing) owns the purse and Google and agencies are only suppliers.  Perhaps I need to say that again – Google and agencies are ONLY suppliers.  If they can’t meet the requirements Marketing people will fire them and go elsewhere.  
As I learnt many years ago the one consistent thing about new technology is that it will inevitably disappoint.  Never bet you job on it.
This is tricky because it involves someone setting themselves up as the arbiter on what is “acceptable” or “abhorrent” and so on. Some of the blame can be laid on Google but not all of it. When you place ads on the Google display Network you can be very specific about where your ads should NOT be shown, as well as where they should. If you don’t do the exclusions properly then don’t come crying when you get shown next to the big bad wolf.
It’s not so easy of course, for videos. Someone might post a video of  something  awful,  and give it an Alt Tag of something quite innocuous like “a lovely day out with the family.” YouTube doesn’t know any different – they haven’t quite got to the stage where they can tell what a video is about without actually watching it.
is this the digital equivalent of guilt by association and the celebrity endorsement disaster, like seeing Ursain wearing Uggs – and where can I get that black box of turds and spiders…
This is an issue I have been fighting against since I left the Corporate world in 2008. The majority of digital advertising is rotten to the core as exceptionally outlined by adcontrarianblogspot recently.
When as an internet publisher, re Bullitthd.com we approached a so called reputable company to assist re advertising and they informed us they do not allow us to tell their customers where they are featured. WTF? 
Yes Google has a responsibility but let’s stop blaming the vehicle rather than those that fuel it. The useless Media companies and the lazy brand managers that neither provide value for money or even know where it is spent. And we wonder why Marketing has such a poor reputation in the C-Suite? Earn your money not expect it!
The un-intended outcome – a positive of this might be that Google & other sites start monitoring all the hateful vicious content posted and either rate them (warnings before you see the link) or even delete the ones from ISIS.
Being hopeful here, but that would be one great outcome from this episode
I have read a few articles on this issue.  However I could not see if those big brands who found their ads on inappropriate online content did implement the brand safety measures on DBM or AdWords such as sensitive content category exclusions, etc.  In my experience, if you put proper content category exclusions, audience categories or blacklisting some URLs that are already notorious for distributing adult, gaming, political extremist, terror…etc., your sites will not appear on those content
The problem is, of course, that the whole system is totally out of control.  
5 billion videos are watched on YouTube every day.  300 hours of video are uploaded to it every minute. Nobody can possibly know what all that content is.  Not even YouTube itself. 
Couple that with a media planning and buying function that’s become increasingly automated and software reliant, and there is nobody making sensible decisions about appropriate placement or context.  At least, not until the shit hit the fan and now there’s utter panic .
The outcome was entirely predictable to any thinking person.  But not to the algorithms, it seems.
If the advertisers boycotting YouTube and Google weren’t hopelessly inept in digital advertising, then they would know the simple tweaks that anyone can do to filter out YouTube channels and GDN Publishers that are “extremist”. The most simple four step guide can be found here: https://e27.co/protect-brand-extremist-content-4-steps-20170405/
Completely agree. No excuses.
Just like google’s unwillingness to pay an ethical amount of tax, programmatic is another example of how Google is clearly more powerful than western governments in many ways. Google are quite literally, unable to control the monster they’ve created. It ran out the door and out of sight years ago.
Banning the purchase of programmatic in responsible nations would be a great step forward. I bet then google might consider investing in the staff and technology required to certify that clients funds are not being given to such organisations.
Trying to get any support out of google is a nightmare at the best of times. If they won’t pay ethical levels of tax, and can’t control their tech, how can we trust them with the awesome things in the pipeline that genuinely could help humanity e.g. Driverless cars.
Google faces damage to both its reputation and revenues but marketers also need to take responsibility for where their ads appear and stop the focus on price over quality in the digital space.
Google admits it could be doing more to ensure ad safety as the UK ad industry finally speaks up over the issue of advertising appearing next to extremist content.
Google’s new boss Ronan Harris defends the company’s record on viewability and measurement in the face of rising advertiser concerns.
It’s all very well spouting West Coast mantras about ‘failing fast’, but agencies need encouragement to get things wrong, says Robin Bonn, founder of Co:definery.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.
The laundry app’s chief Ed Relf on building brands by focusing on trust and why marketers make the best entrepreneurs.

The Google memo by engineer James Damore, attacking the company for pursuing gender diversity, shows how damaging it is to make sex-based assumptions – but it also reveals big political problems for the web giant.

Shop Direct’s CEO believes chatbots will be the next big thing for retailers, but admits there is a big challenge when it comes to inserting a marketing message into the mix.
Shop Direct is placing an increasing proportion of its budget into chatbots, with the retail group’s CEO Alex Baldock stating its customers do “not want to wait for an email but want instant interaction”.
Speaking at a session at Advertising Week Europe yesterday (20 March) about digital economy marketing, Baldock spoke about how the company is responding to technological change.
Shop Direct, which owns digital brands such as Very.com and Littlewoods, launched its own chatbot last year within the Very app in a bid to respond to customer queries. And Baldock says the fact that Amazon and Microsoft are doing the same has validated its decision.
“Consumers are used to chatting to friends online. However, increasingly, customers want to chat to businesses too. They want instant interaction in their own language – they don’t want to wait a few days for an email,” he explained.
“You have Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Windows’ Cortana. There have been attempts by other players to tap into this, so there is a need for intelligent assistance. We launched our own last year and we are placing a big bet on it moving forwards.”
Baldock also claimed artificial intelligence (AI) will transform “every part” of personalisation and “democratise the personal shopper”.

However, despite Shop Direct’s commitment to chatbots and AI, Baldock admitted there is still a big challenge inserting a marketing message into the mix that “doesn’t irritate the customer”.
“You don’t want to put friction in the [customer experience], so there is a marketing challenge around chatbots. Digital marketing is all about being digital-led, automated and personalised. And AI is tailormade to add a shot of adrenaline to all of those things,” he explained.
He revealed the ecommerce giant is also looking into how it could use virtual reality within its marketing activity.
Baldock concluded: “VR will be big in retail. Why wouldn’t it be? It [mixes] physical and online retail. It is still entirely unexplored [for us] and while it does have its white knuckle moments, we’re going to stick at exploring [how best we can use] it.”
Retail is becoming a world of extremes. Brands either need to remove complexity and make the process as simple as possible, or add it in to create a “delightful” experience, says Tom Goodwin, executive vice-president and head of innovation at Zenith USA.
Project between Unilever, Aimia, Sainsbury’s, i2c, Nielsen and the IAB aimed to quantify the impact of online display advertising on FMCG sales and brand awareness.
Instagram is hoping to convince both brands and consumers that it can become a shop, not just a shop window, but it faces a number of challenges.
UK advertisers are increasingly mimicking the US by moving towards building in-house and on-site expertise, a new study suggests.

Just Eat’s marketing budget is “way bigger” than its spend on technology, and it sees TV as harder to measure than digital advertising.
Just Eat’s marketing budget is a “whopping figure”, according to chief marketing officer Barnaby Dawe, who believes it has to be that way in a high-growth business.
Speaking today (20 March) at Advertising Week Europe, he said it is absolutely right that marketing should be one of the biggest spends for the business, and that the brand spends more on marketing than technology.
Dawe said he is “trying to drive efficiencies” so the “ratio of marketing spend to revenue gets lower as we get older – our marketing budgets might increase but they shouldn’t increase at the same rate as revenue”.
He added: “I’m conscious that the board, the CFO and the CEO feel that money is being well spent. That means having acute measurement tactics.”
These metrics are split into commercial measurement in food orders and active customers, NPS scores among customers and restaurant partners, and marketing measurement.
The CMO believes “TV is the one that is hardest to measure” although he also said Just Eat sees growth when it does TV advertising – where it trials regionally before going “full pelt”.
When it comes to allocating budget to TV and top of the funnel activity, he said it’s very hard to justify to the CFO and the board but “when you get further down the funnel it becomes much more measurable”.

Dawe said Just Eat plans to double Facebook spend this year because it allows the business to talk about the brand and engage people but also “go right down to transaction” and shift people to conversion.
The brand is also placing a bigger focus on new technology such as virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to ensure it stays ahead of the curve, as new players enter what is already a competitive sector.

Dawe said Just Eat invests in “small startups in the food tech space” to help it disrupt itself, and although his remit spans “many things” it’s important to start “building a brand for the future”.
He added: “A lot of [digital-only] businesses make the mistake of investing for the short-term and not building a brand story.”
They should spend more persuading their participating food outlets not to inflate their prices for delivery to me!!

The BBC will seek to position itself as the voice of a diverse and divergent Britain, offering viewers a seamless, personalised experience.
The BBC believes it can unite a divided and diverse post-Brexit Britain by dialling up its creativity, personalisation and global ambition.
Speaking at the Media & Telecoms 2017 conference in London last week (2 March), BBC deputy director general Anne Bulford underlined what she sees as the BBC’s crucial role in helping the UK forge a new global identity in an uncertain world.
“In a fragmented UK it is the BBC’s role to represent the whole of the country and to reflect all of its diverse voices and increasingly divergent politics. In the fake news era it is part of our mission to be a trusted voice in a crowded arena, to help audiences cut through the noise and separate out opinion from fact,” she said.
“We punch well above our weight worldwide and as one of the country’s most valuable exports we help the UK punch above its weight too.”
Bulford outlined her ambition for the BBC to be defined by boldness and originality both on screen and online. To achieve this she explained the need to reinvent iPlayer, as well as capitalise on new technologies such as artificial intelligence, voice recognition and virtual reality.
The BBC deputy director general argued that personalisation will prove essential to the broadcaster’s future success, combined with a desire to reinvent public service broadcasting through data. To date the BBC has made six billion recommendations to viewers and listeners, with 238 million stories being opened through personalised news alerts and a further 2 billion personalised sports alerts sent out by BBC Sport.
“Our goal is that by our centenary year in 2022 we will have reinvented a BBC which is irresistible to its audience. In a world of near limitless choice we want people to keep choosing us for our British content and our trusted viewpoint on the world,” said Bulford.
She acknowledged that the old way of working in siloes and operating with budgets agreed five years previously is no longer possible.
“We need to be seamless about how we work together across the technical and editorial teams, more liberal in how we allocate budgets and more responsive to how we react to rapid changes across our industry,” she added.
“To reinvent the BBC for a new generation we have to be much more entrepreneurial in our make up. We also want to be much more ambitious for the BBC globally.”
Reflecting on the global importance of British programming, 21st Century Fox CEO and Sky chairman James Murdoch emphasised the continued resonance of British films and television, describing the ‘Made in the UK’ stamp as a shorthand for smart, off-centre storytelling.
In the week when 21st Century Fox was expected announce its $14.4bn (£11.7bn) bid to acquire a remaining 60% stake in European broadcaster Sky, Murdoch recognised his company is operating in “an unprecedented competitive environment”.
However, instead of “simply chasing blockbusters”, 21st Century Fox has committed to what Murdoch called a “deliberately diverse” strategy.
“There remains an enduring opportunity for a diverse output of television and film. This year we will produce almost 500 original series, over 20,000 hours of entertainment programmes and the UK features heavily in that,” he added.
“Together 21st Century Fox and Sky invested around £700m last year in original production in the UK alone. We intend to continue at least that level of investment while building on Sky’s already outstanding original content.”
Murdoch confirmed 21st Century Fox had conducted a core realignment based catering to the future of video, in a bid to compete with an army of “new entrants armed with fresh capital and a predisposition for disruption.”
As the storm continues to rage around fake news from the White House to Whitehall, Murdoch recognised a shift sensing of what the term really means and how it is affecting media outlets.
“In the summer we were talking about fake news in terms of delivering falsehoods disseminated through social media to make money from Facebook. Now that’s been co-opted by the political class to denigrate things that they don’t want to hear and that’s happening around the world,” he explained.
Google UK & Ireland managing director Ronan Harris also acknowledged the problem of defining fake news and how this plays into the search engine’s responsibility to prevent the spread of false information and hate.
“We are trying to determine exactly what is fake news and I don’t think anyone in this room has a perfect answer to that. It seems quite complex,” said Harris.
“We’ve put a huge amount of engineering and human resource into working in the area of hate speech online and offensive content. We’ve got a huge responsibility to make sure that we’re helping to root our truly offensive content online, but we also have to make sure we protect the principles of free speech online.”
When challenged on The Times investigation revealing advertisers such as Marie Curie and Mercedes Benz were inadvertently funding hate sites through programmatic advertising, Harris was keen to emphasise the complexity of the problem.

“In the conversations we have with agencies and marketers they want choice, they want to be able to maximise their reach.
“We’ve done a good enough job to make sure we’ve got the balance right between making sure we give everyone choice and also educating all of the people in the distribution chain about where they want to show up. It’s an area we are working on closely with the advertisers.”

While it’s important to plan for the future, when it comes to 5G brands shouldn’t get ahead of themselves as 4G is still in its relative infancy and there are many opportunities still to be explored.
Brands are quick to get excited about the possibilities that connected cars and homes, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and drones can offer, but all of this technology requires network capability. It is important, therefore, that brands think more about the business case for investing in any new technology and the capabilities required to avoid being blinded by the hype.
One area to watch is the rush to 5G, which dominated the headlines at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona last week. While it will be hugely important in the long term, brands shouldn’t fast forward too quickly without exploring all the opportunities 4G has to offer.
Kester Mann, principal operators analyst at CCS Insight, says: “5G was one of the big themes at MWC – it has been for the last three years now – but it’s disappointing as a lot of things such as the Internet of Things and virtual reality can still be well-served by some of the 4G networks.”
Brands including Nokia, Samsung, Verizon and AT&T all talked up their 5G plans. Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri unveiled 5G First, a commercial offering for carriers eager to be the first to meet the demand for faster connectivity that will be available in the second half of 2017.
The move is part of Nokia’s business strategy to expand into sectors including healthcare wearables, virtual reality and connected devices.
Nokia CMO Barry French, says: “There are many different operators with different strategies but [a lot] of them believe they’ve done what they can do with the base connectivity.”
He adds: “That is their core competence but they want to go increasingly into value added areas as the world moves to ‘everything connected’. Someone has to not just connect those devices but make sense of all of them. The operators are in a good position to do that.”
[There is still] quite a bit to be done in terms of the quality and the coverage of the [4G] networks before we start thinking about some of the super-fast speeds that 5G is going to enable.
Samsung was another key player pushing 5G. At a keynote speech it revealed plans for the UK trial of its 5G network to deliver on commitments to the Internet of Things and connected devices.

Meanwhile, culture secretary Karen Bradley set out the government’s digital strategy last week, which includes a greater focus on connectivity and the roll out of 5G as Bradley says the quality of connection is what matters the most, not the means of delivery.
But companies must be careful not to get ahead of themselves. Before looking at 5G technology brands should focus on what can be done with 4G connectivity.
Although MWC was largely about 5G, Mann says “some of the people that attended the event missed the point that a lot can be done with 4G as well”. However, he adds “in the very long term 5G will be necessary to connect all the billions of devices” that were on show.
In 4G Mann says there is still “quite a bit to be done in terms of the quality and the coverage of the networks, particularly in buildings and rural areas and across transport infrastructures before we start thinking about some of the super-fast speeds that 5G is going to enable”.
Nokia has said it is looking to boost 4G connectivity in London through a new partnership with Telefónica and Suri predicted that investments in 4G, particularly advanced 4G technologies, will pick up again in key markets. He said: “Even [with] 5G coming, the need for more capacity grows everyday with no sign of slowing.”
5G has the potential to drive new opportunities and brands are investing in parallel industries and markets because of it. However Mann says: “It’s all very well the investment in the technology and saying how fantastic 5G is but we are still struggling from a provider or operator point of view [on] where the use case is going to be, what the business models are and where the money is going to be created to justify these investments.”
Instead of being wowed by the next big thing, brands should think about what can happen now, how processes can be improved, and when looking at new technology to invest in, think of the end goal rather than buy into the hype.
Everyone wants to be first but pushing forward on making 5G a reality requires businesses to work together. Although 25 mobile operators have announced they are lab-testing 5G, the consensus among speakers at the Global 5G Test Summit during MWC was that it’s important to give other industries a taste of what’s coming with 5G so they can explore new use models and applications.
Speakers at the summit including China Mobile, AT&T, Huawei, Vodafone and Intel said early testing could help brands understand the actual requirements of various applications.
This might create a step-change in how sectors work together. However, Vice’s CEO and co-founder, Shane Smith, said that whenever it tries to do something different people “try and stop you every step of the way”. He urged sectors, both traditional and digital, to break down the “old barriers” or risk “what happened to the music industry” and end up “holding on to an ever-shrinking piece of the pie”.
Greater collaboration, a well thought out brand strategy for investing in new technology, and fixing current capabilities and demand for services such as 4G, are therefore required before leaping to 5G and connected everything.
Mobile World Congress: Samsung acknowledged the difficulties it faced last year after its flagship phone problems in a noticeably more low key event that saw the brand reveal plans for a UK trial of its 5G network as it strives to deliver on commitments to the internet of things and connected devices.
Mobile World Congress: Nokia is focusing on 5G technology as it looks to take advantage of “faster growing markets” such as VR and wearables.

Gareth Maguire, marketing director at Kellogg UK & Ireland talks to Marketing Week about finding new sources of creativity and using social to respond to its audience in real time.
Kellogg’s Corn Flakes is an iconic UK brand. Therefore we thought it important that our next campaign represented current modern Britain, and looking forward versus a nostalgic look back. We worked with Leo Burnett to create something that was fresh, new and ultimately different from what we have done before. We are always listening to insights from our customers and consumers because we want to talk to our core audience, look at what has and hasn’t worked previously and keep a close eye on our competitors.
READ MORE: The future of creativity in an automated world
How did the idea for the new Corn Flakes ad campaign come about?
We had a discussion within our team about what makes people love Corn Flakes. The key thing that came back was everyone eats them differently for one reason or another. We decided to open up the discussion on social media platforms, and ask ‘how do you eat yours?’ Very quickly we were pleasantly surprised by the large amount of debate around the versatility of the product. The main thing was people felt passionately about how they ate their Corn Flakes, passionately enough to engage and to share on Facebook. We managed to reach out to Corn Flakes ‘superfans’ online and they agreed to be in the campaign. It’s real people, and their way of enjoying the food.

By moving a large proportion of our marketing towards socially driven content on our Twitter, Facebook and Instagram channels, we are engaging on a platform we know people will want to communicate and digest our messages. More people have seen the new campaign on their phone than on TV in the past two weeks. The use of social media allows us to respond to our audience in real time, and we are able to monitor the content response and dial up and down depending on the engagement.
Kellogg’s Special K is moving away from branding itself as a product used for dieting, after it found women now prefer to “take a more holistic approach” when it comes to food.
Kellogg’s has been criticised by the ASA for not clearly backing up claims that its products are “full of goodness” and “nutritious”.
Kellogg’s will use its sponsorship of Team GB during the upcoming Olympic games in Rio next year to reaffirm its presence with British consumers and place its products at the forefront of people’s minds.
Innovation does not have to involve taking a gamble on costly, ‘disruptive’ projects. It is often more profitable to refine and reimagine already popular products.

Business leaders need to stand up for human-sponsored creativity as the AI revolution takes hold.
Ever feel as though the joy has been sucked from your job? The once fun, creative aspects of your marketing role – the things you signed up for in the first place – are now handed off to data specialists, algorithms and machines. Technology is on its inevitable march and you are starting to feel as obsolete as the old fax machine in the corner of the office…
This scenario may seem overly pessimistic, but it is one that more and more marketers are confronting as automation seeps into every facet of their jobs. In the space of a few years programmatic marketing has gone from a niche, hi-tech concept to a commonly understood practice that companies are scrambling to deploy to achieve better, more efficient targeting. Machine learning is advancing all the time and artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the way marketers do everything from data capture to campaign messaging.
So does this age of digital automation signal the end of human-generated creativity? A sweep of opinions across the marketing community shows divergent views on the future of creativity, but broad acceptance that the way ideas are taken to market is changing post-haste.

Former HSBC head of marketing Philip Mehl was unequivocal when he argued that marketing “is a data challenge now” and that the pursuit of true creativity in marketing is all but dead. On the other hand, YouTube’s Richard Waterworth pointed to the grey area between the twin pillars of creativity and automation and the need for marketers to continue viewing certain aspects of their role as “more of an art than a science”. Human imagination remains vital to retaining “brand magic”, he argued.
In a sense both marketers are right. Given the plethora of consumer-facing technologies and media channels that exist, it is clear that brands are now competing first and foremost on how quickly and efficiently they can reach the right customers. In that context it is easy to see how creativity could become a secondary issue.

Yet brands also need to hit their targets with the right messaging, and it is here that human empathy remains vitally important, even if AI technology one day achieves human-like emotional sophistication. Marketing is a holistic business function, not a zero-sum game of data, targets and messages, and it will always require people to think creatively about a brand’s larger place in the world and the strategy required to connect with human beings.
Of course, marketing departments and the skill sets within them need to adapt to the age of automation. But business leaders also need to ensure that as their companies automate processes, they allow their employees the space to think for themselves and express themselves creatively. The brands that succeed in getting the balance right will be those that thrive in the future.
The majority of content created by brands is having little or no impact on business results or people’s lives, according to Havas’ latest ‘Meaningful Brands’ study.
Having the space to feel relaxed, confident and inspired is helping marketers stay creative in a hyper-connected world.
As marketing becomes increasingly automated, brands need to ensure creativity and innovation don’t suffer as a result.
Gareth Maguire, marketing director at Kellogg UK & Ireland talks to Marketing Week about finding new sources of creativity and using social to respond to its audience in real time.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

Airbnb has closed a funding round of more than $1bn (£820m) that values the company at more than $31bn (£25.5bn). The funding is part of its Series F round, which it began raising in June last year. Airbnb has declined to say who the new backers are, but previous investors include Google parent Alphabet’s venture capital arm GV. It has raised more than $3.5bn (£2.9b) in total.
The round makes Airbnb one of the most highly valued US tech businesses, with its valuation rising by around 25% over the past two years. Airbnb has also revealed it became profitable in the second half of last year and that it expects to be profitable (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) again in 2017.

Aldi has updated its logo for the first time in more than 10 years as part of a visual redesign of the brand aimed to reflects its “current process of modernisation”. The logo is already in use in China but will be rolled out across markets in Europe, including the UK, from this summer. The logo retains Aldi’s blue background and yellow, orange and red border but changes the font and gives the ‘A’ more of a “wave design”.
“The fresh visual design of the new logo is ideal for the current process of modernisation of Aldi Süd.
“For our customers, this is reflected by the ongoing development of our product range, redesigning our branches or actions as the next pop-up store,” says Kirsten Gess, communication director for Aldi Süd.

Volkswagen is set to plead guilty today (10 March) to three felony counts in the US Justice Department’s diesel emissions investigation, according to Reuters. As part of a plea agreement, Volkswagen has agreed to reforms, audits and oversight by an independent monitor for three years.
The move comes after the car marque admitted to cheating on emissions tests by installing secret software in its vehicles that could tell when its cars were being tested and make it look like they complied with emissions standards when they did not. While Volkswagen took a short-term hit to brand and sales, it recently overtook Toyota to become the world’s biggest car seller.

Akzo Nobel, the company behind Dulux paint, has rejected an unsolicited $22bn (£18bn) takeover offer from US Rival PPG Industries. Akzo Nobel said the deal “substantially undervalues” the company and its long-term growth opportunities.
The move comes less than a month after Kraft Heinz attempted a similar hostile takeover of Unilever in a $143bn (£117bn) deal. While both Unilever and Akzo Nobel have rejected the deals, the offers have led to questions about their ongoing growth, with Akzo saying it now plans to spin off its chemicals business.

Facebook is launching a new feature for its Messenger app that copies Snapchat’s Stories idea. MEssenger Day lets users share either publicly or either with a specific friend decorated photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. It is available for its iOS and Android apps, with content appearing at the top of the chat app.
This is not the first time Facebook has taken inspiration from one of Snapchat’s features; Instagram already has a Stories feature. Facebook says its move is different, with the Messenger feature aimed at helping people plan their days and arrange meet-ups, rather than showing off what people have been up to.

The News Media Association (NMA) has called for an urgent investigation into the impact of Google, Facebook and the digital advertising supply chain on the spread of fake news.
In its submission to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s inquiry into fake news, the NMA said action needs to be taken to ensure agenda setting journalism can survive and thrive in the digital environment.
“News media publishers are by far the biggest investors in original news content, accounting for 58% of the total UK investment,” said NMA chairman Ashley Highfield.
“But the digital supply chain rewards the distributors of content, not the originators. Government and regulators cannot ignore forever the impact of the Google-Facebook duopoly on our media landscape.”
The NMA attributes the rise of programmatic advertising to a growing lack of transparency, which it argued has caused advertisers to be left in the dark about how their money is being spent.
The association added that while the UK has so far proved more resilient to fake news, it fears the diversion of digital advertising revenues away from content creators to Google and Facebook could create the conditions for a thriving fake news industry in Britain.

Morrisons sales rose 1.7% for the year ending 29 January 2017, its first year of positive like-for-like sales growth since 2011/12.
Sales growth was positive for each quarter, rising by 2.5% during the fourth quarter alone. The supermarket also grew turnover by 1.2% to £16.3bn, despite store closures.
“Our full year of like-for-like sales and profit growth was powered by listening to customers,” said chief executive David Potts.
“But, it’s only one year. Our turnaround has just started, and we have more plans and important work ahead. If we keep improving the customer shopping trip, I am confident that Morrisons will continue to grow.”
The company credits its “Fix, Rebuild and Grow strategy” for helping to create a stronger business, highlighting the strength of new partnerships with Amazon, Ocado, Timpson, Rontec, and the revival of the Safeway brand.
The supermarket is also planning to open a further 40 ‘Morrisons Daily’ convenience stores in partnership with forecourt company Rontec.
While expressing confidence in its turnaround plan, Morrisons acknowledged there were uncertainties ahead, in particular the impact on imported food prices if the pound remains at lower levels.

Just one in 50 people applying for a job at Pret A Manger is British, leading to fears the food chain could struggle to recruit staff post-Brexit.
Speaking to the House of Lords economic affairs select committee, Pret A Manger HR director Andrea Wareham said the company would find it “virtually impossible” to find enough staff if it were unable to hire EU nationals after Brexit.
Currently 65% of Pret A Manger’s workforce originate from EU countries outside Britain, with the high street chain employing 110 different nationalities in total. Wareham argued that the business needs to work with education and career services to make British teenagers think that working at somewhere like Pret A Manger was “a success”.

Adidas’ net income exceeded the €1bn mark for the first time in its history after an “exceptional 2016”, piling pressure on US rivals Nike and Under Armour.
The German sportswear giant’s sales grew 16% in 2016 to €19.3bn, with net income up 41% to €1.1bn, success CEO Kasper Rorsted attributes to an improvement in the desirability of its brands and products globally.
Revenues for the Adidas brand rose 22%, driven by double-digit sales increases in its Sport Performance range, as well as Adidas Originals and Adidas Neo trainer collections. While revenues grew 20% in Western Europe, there were greater increases in North America and China, where sales climbed 24% and 28%, respectively.
Encouraged by growing demand for the brand in 2016, Adidas forecasts sales to rise 11%-13% in 2017.

The Premier League has been given the power to block servers used to power rights-infringing video streams.
Whereas previously the Premier League could only target individual streams, which were relatively easy to re-establish, the court order now allows it to block servers powering the pirated Kodi set-top boxes.
A spokesperson said this was the first time the Premier League would be able to disrupt and prevent the illegal streaming of its matches.

Nestlé has announced it will remove 10% of the sugar content from all its snacks in the UK and Ireland by 2018.
The company, which makes brands such as KitKat, Quality Street, Smarties and Yorkie, said it was responding to public health concerns around obesity levels and unhealthy food.
Nestlé also stated that it would not replace sugar with artificial sweeteners and would instead look at other ways of redesigning its products. “We are not announcing specific changes to brands at this stage but over the coming months and years we will introduce revised products that make incremental reductions on sugar in different ways that, when added up, make a big difference overall to the nation’s diet while still maintaining taste,” a spokesperson said.

Facebook has launched a new measurement tool aimed at making it easier for advertisers of all sizes to track user behaviour across devices.
Called Advanced Measurement, the tool supplements the existing Atlas measurement platform that serves large enterprises.
It will appear within Facebook Business Manager in the form of self-serve dashboards that will help marketers measure different aspects of their campaigns, such as the number of people reached and the ads that best generate conversions.
“Previously, these tools were only available in Atlas for the largest enterprise marketers,” said Facebook’s product marketing director for measurement Scott Shapiro. “We’re expanding the access of functionality that only existed in Atlas to tens of thousands of marketers who use Facebook’s ad tools.”

Nike has announced plans to launch a sportswear hijab to cater for female Muslim athletes.
The lightweight, single-layer Pro Hijab was developed after athletes complained that wearing traditional hijabs hindered their ability to compete.
It follows a viral video campaign from Nike entitled ‘What will they say about you?’, which shows Muslim female athletes exercising and competing.
“By providing Muslim athletes with the most groundbreaking products, like the Nike Pro Hijab, Nike aims to serve today’s pioneers as well as inspire even more women and girls in the region who still face barriers and limited access to sport,” the company said in a statement.

Twitter is working on a new ad product that gurantaees to serve a set amount of video ads in a similar way to TV buying.
The social network has partnered with Dentsu Aegis Network to develop the product, which has already been tested with about a dozen brands, Advertising Age reports.
The product allows brands to order a set amount of pre-roll video ads that run before premium content and are targeted at specific demographics. Twitter is using Media Ratings Council standards in the US to measure the campaigns.
Dentsu’s executive VP of video investment Michael Law said the guaranteed campaigns can cost in the “low six figures”.

Food prices surged last month as a consequence of the ongoing impact of Brexit.
Figures from Kantar Worldpanel show that grocery inflation doubled to 1.4% in the 12 weeks to the end of February compared to the same period to the end of January. The hike is primarly due to rising import costs as a result of the weakening pound since the EU referendum.
Meanwhile separate data from Nielsen shows that discounters Aldi and Lidl now account for more than 12% of grocery sales in Britain. “Discounter market share is higher than when Kwik Save was at its pomp as the original discounter,” said Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer and business insight.

Non-food sales declined by 0.4% in the quarter to February for the first time since November 2011, according to the retail sales monitor reported by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG.
It’s another indication that consumer spending is slowing. GfK’s monthly consumer confidence index shows that British consumers are moving away from making major purchases as concerns about the economy hit confidence amid warnings that if this continues economic growth could slow down this year.

Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson is calling on Ofcom to investigate Rupert Murdoch’s planned takeover of Sky. Speaking during a debate in the House of Commons, Watson said Ofcom should “look at the whole group of Murdoch-owned and controlled companies in assessing whether the Sky takeover would threaten media plurality” taking into account failures of corporate governance over phone-hacking.
He also asked if Ofcom would complete a full “fit and proper person” test before the approval of the merger. Culture secretary Karen Bradley told Watson that Ofcom would have wide powers to examine all the issues he raised.

Snap’s share price dropped 12% yesterday (6 March) to close below Thursday’s (2 March) opening. The shares had risen by 44% from their $17 IPO price, but the stock reversed course on Monday and fell 12.25% to close at $23.77.
Snap Inc, which includes social media site Snapchat and its photo taking sunglasses Spectacles, was valued at $28bn despite never having turned a profit. In its IPO filing, Snap Inc said its ad model is still at an “experimental” stage and that it faces a challenge in convincing advertisers of the veracity of its ad business.

IBM and Salesforce have agreed a deal that will see the integration of their artificial intelligence platforms and some of their software and services to boost their data-analytics offering.
It will see a combination of IBM Watson, which uses machine learning to analyse what is said in public sources such as social media posts, and Salesforce’s sales-led Einstein, which taps into its customer data. The companies say the partnership will work because of this difference in AI capabilities.

Following an investigation into digital firm’s involvement in Brexit, the UK’s privacy watchdog is launching an inquiry into how voters’ personal data is being captured and exploited in political campaigns.
This has been cited as a key factor in the Brexit and Trump campaigns.

As marketing becomes increasingly automated, brands need to ensure creativity and innovation don’t suffer as a result.
Is creativity in the marketing industry on a slow death march? Go to any marketing conference or seminar these days and you are likely to hear someone lament declining creative standards and the loss of ‘brand magic’.
Financial pressures have put a squeeze on marketers’ ability to unleash their creative instincts, but of greater concern is the role of technology and automation. The growing influence of programmatic media buying, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have changed the way marketers perform their jobs, potentially putting creativity and independent thought at risk.
HSBC’s former head of marketing in EMEA Philip Mehl hit on this point in a recent Marketing Week roundtable when he declared: “Marketing used to be a creative challenge but it’s a data challenge now.” Mehl argued that brands today primarily compete on how well they can target consumers, rather than on the quality of their ideas.
He also suggested that the flood of branded content across all channels was responsible for lowering the bar for creativity. “When I think of TV ad breaks 20 years ago, probably six out of seven spots were entertaining – now it’s more likely to be one out of seven,” he said. “Marketers have lost a lot of the skill of storytelling and the art of having an impact that actually creates a memory.”
These comments echo a complaint by Dan Izbicki, creative excellence director at Unilever, who dismissed much of the marketing profession’s creative output as “terrible” during the IPA Effectiveness Week conference last November.
“There’s an assumption [in our industry] at the moment that just because everybody has got a camera and access to a YouTube channel, suddenly everybody is a creative director – that’s clearly not true,” he said. “That’s why most advertising is terrible and most films are not very good. [Creativity] is a precious skill.”
These marketers are not alone in identifying a direct correlation between technological advancement and declining creative standards. In a book published last year entitled ‘Lobotomy: The Marginalisation of Creativity and How to Become Human Again’, business analysts Mike Fitzsimons and Sue Bradley argue that the industrial revolution “left a huge sociological and psychological scar” by creating an overly rigid dichotomy between the rational and the creative.
READ MORE: Brands must retain their empathy as automation accelerates
The business culture that emerged rewarded rational thought and logic at the expense of creativity, the book claims, as financial targets took prominence and companies wrongly separated “business people” from “creative people”. Fitzsimons believes that factors such as automation and AI have the potential to accelerate this trend.
“There is a risk that the uniqueness that creativity brings to the world and its decision-making process is being marginalised by what I would call continual, systemic automation, where everything now is being targeted in terms of [turning it into] a process,” he says. “That includes creativity. Certainly, artificial intelligence is being used in a way that almost makes the essential element of being human less viable.”
Fitzsimons says that increased automation could undermine the distinctive nature of brands and reduce the scope for innovation. “Creativity is about the infinite – it’s about things that you have never thought about and making connections that have never been made,” he says.
“While some systems can bring a bit of that to the game, most systems don’t. They basically automate what’s already known and therefore you almost get a race to the bottom where everybody knows the same thing but no one has the edge – they don’t know the next thing. That only arrives by giving humans the space to use the creative side to their mind and then by knotting that together with the already well developed logical and rational processes that we have.”
Despite this outlook, Fitzsimons notes that some of the big technology giants such as Google have succeeded in creating a workplace culture of creativity. “They are on the edge of new products all the time so they know they need creative input, but they are also heavily systemic,” he says. “There are things to be learned from these companies about giving [people] time to be creative and showing that you value it as a business.”
Richard Waterworth, director of marketing in EMEA for YouTube, which is owned by Google, insists that creativity remains “more of an art than a science” and that it should sit alongside automation rather than be consumed by it. He concedes, though, that finding the right balance is an ongoing challenge.
“For a long time, even before the disruption of digital media, the advertising industry lived by the motto ‘right place, right time, right message’,” he says. “We have seen huge advances in the first two, largely owing to developments in the programmatic space, but we’re still navigating the last, and that is the key to maintaining brand magic.”
Waterworth cites YouTube’s recent ‘Made for You’ campaign as an example of automation and creativity coming together for optimum impact. The campaign featured 18 of the platform’s self-made ‘creators’, including musicians, comedians and fashion vloggers. YouTube then used data and retargeting to decide which combination of adverts would best resonate with target viewers, both online and in cinemas.
“This is a great example of how online data can play a fundamental role in improving creativity, not just for digital formats but traditional media too,” says Waterworth.
Most companies lack the resources of Google, of course, but it is incumbent on all brands to find the right balance between creativity and automation. In January, Skipton Building Society launched a TV advertising campaign for the first time in a decade with a spot that urges customers to take a ‘pause moment’ and think about their financial futures.
It’s hard to emotionally engage with data – it’s not very good at helping you understand people’s emotions.
Commercial director Ian Cornelius says that while the business is automating some of its processes and making increased use of data, it is conscious of the need to pitch its new campaign on an emotional level. “Data is more powerful than it has ever been and there is a place for it, but it can’t give you the whole answer,” he says.
“It’s hard to emotionally engage with data – it’s not very good at helping you understand people’s emotions. There’s no substitute for getting really close to your customers, talking to them and understanding what’s important to them. Data helps more from a validation point of view or a targeting point of view, but it doesn’t really give you that rich insight to enable you to build a creative platform. Being close to your customers does.”
Skipton worked closely with its advertising agency BJL to impart these customer insights and ensure the campaign achieved the right tone of voice for the brand. BJL creative director Richard Pearson believes agencies can help brands to take a step back from automated processes and think about how best to communicate with consumers.
“In some ways that’s what a creative [agency’s] job has always really been – to try to translate the facts and things that a brand wants to tell people, into a way that consumers are going to connect with and understand, and feel emotionally,” he says.
Kellogg’s Corn Flakes is another brand that has chosen to refresh its advertising this year following a long period away from screens. Kellogg’s has invested £10m in a nine-month campaign for the brand after a five-year break in commercial marketing activity in the UK. This includes TV adverts featuring real people talking about how they like to eat and serve Corn Flakes.
READ MORE: Kellogg’s on representing ‘modern Britain’
Gareth Maguire, marketing director at Kellogg UK & Ireland, says that in order to achieve a fresh and creative approach with the campaign, his team tried to avoid being overly nostalgic about the 93-year-old brand. This involved thinking about the way that technology has changed people’s media consumption habits. The brand’s social media activity around the campaign involves asking people to share their views on what makes the ‘perfect bowl’ of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes.
“Kellogg’s Corn Flakes has remained one of our core sellers because it resonates with people from their childhood days,” notes Maguire. “Where the challenge lies with this campaign is to reignite that conversation and to jog people’s memories. Therefore our marketing focus has had to shift to reflect the way our consumers are digesting advertising messages.”
Our marketing focus has had to shift to reflect the way our consumers are digesting advertising messages.
Blake Cahill, global head of digital and social marketing at Philips, agrees that brands need to adjust their approach to creativity to take into account new consumer behaviours. This includes reassessing how marketers think about storytelling and content to ensure they can immediately grab attention online.
“Looking at recent Facebook stats, you have 1.7 seconds to draw someone in to watch a video,” he says. “In that sense the content and the creative is still the trigger, but it has been chopped up into lots of bits, rather than [a traditional] 30-second or one-minute spot.”
Cahill adds that brands should think about these content formats at the very start of the creative process. “You have to go into the creative briefing process with the different formats and technologies as inputs for the creative you need to make, because if you cut down [creative work] after the fact – retro-fitting round holes into square pegs – that doesn’t work.”
To coincide with the World Economic Forum (WEF) in January, Philips launched a digital campaign featuring children talking about different global issues, such as healthcare. Cahill explains that the campaign, which has attracted around half a million video views, involved taking a risk by eschewing the normal format of marketing campaigns during WEF, which tend to feature political and business leaders. Instead, Cahill and his team had to back their creative instincts – and convince other Philips executives – that the campaign approach was the right way forward.
“Content and creativity is always going to be the kernel at the heart of anything you do,” he says. “Technology and automation just allows everyone to be potentially more targeted and do things at greater scale.”
So what can marketers expect in the years ahead, and how can they push the case for creativity as processes become increasingly automated? Ian Liddicoat, global head of data technology and analytics at media agency Zenith, predicts that AI technology will soon permeate all aspects of the customer journey, changing the way marketers do their jobs.
“That will be a major area of focus for a lot of brands and technology companies, and there will also be a lot more integration between organisations like ours and the big technology companies,” he says. “The fact that we can push a machine learned result to a DSP (demand-side advertising platform) today would not have happened even two years ago.”
He adds: “We’re going to be pushing more machine learned results to more different forms of technology very actively, which means that what the consumer sees is a closed loop process that simply delivers a more personalised, relevant and timely communication.”
Automation is definitely freeing up time for us to focus on being more genuinely creative and personalised with our activity.
Despite this prediction, Liddicoat does not believe that technology will automatically undermine the role of creativity. He notes, for example, that Zenith is now conducting controlled tests that involve using machine learning to deconstruct text, video and graphics into multiple permutations, before reconstructing them into different creative executions targeted at different sets of consumers.
“My view is that [automation] empowers creative thinking – it does not in any way reduce the importance of a very strong creative idea that’s tied to a strategy and then executed through technology and data,” says Liddicoat.
“It requires new talent, new processes and new ways of working, where strategists and creative thinkers become more used to working with data in a much shorter cadence that’s being generated from a machine learned result.”
On the client-side, Aviva’s head of marketing James Turner claims that increased automation is “an exciting challenge” that is generating new opportunities across the business. “Some of the automation is definitely freeing up time for us to focus on being more genuinely creative and personalised with our activity rather than just cranking the handle to get stuff live,” he adds.
“We are definitely learning there are new processes and procedures that we need to follow and different skill sets that we need to hire. Some of the more traditional campaign management and creative roles are evolving really quickly.”

Turner says there is still no simple answer to the age-old question of whether marketing is an art or a science. Ultimately, automation is driving up the performance of marketing in all its various forms.
“I don’t think [the art or the science] are mutually exclusive,” he declares. “With the data comes more scope to be genuinely relevant and do so through great creative. Given the way that great brands are doing it, consumer expectations are really high, so there’s a significant benchmark for us to achieve.”

Should marketers fear for their jobs or embrace the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, so they can adapt now and stay relevant in the future?
Business leaders need to stand up for human-sponsored creativity as the AI revolution takes hold.
Retail is becoming a world of extremes. Brands either need to remove complexity and make the process as simple as possible, or add it in to create a “delightful” experience, says Tom Goodwin, executive vice-president and head of innovation at Zenith USA.

The Government’s new digital strategy aims to ready the world for digital by supporting creative industries with developments in data and AI.
The Government’s new digital strategy has outlined key changes it wants to make in 2017, including a heavy focus on AI, data and to create new markets for the UK’s creative industries.
In a speech today (1 March), culture secretary Karen Bradley says the digital sector needs to be taken seriously as it is now worth 7% of the the economy and grew nearly three times faster than comparable sectors in 2015.
“But that does not mean that we can stand still. And just keeping up should not be the limit of our ambitions. The UK must lead the world. Meanwhile, none of our citizens should be left behind,” Bradley explains.
Bradley says it is The Government’s ambition for the digital sector to continue growing and by 2025 for its contribution to the economy to rise to £200bn. In order to do this, it plans to invest heavily in new technology and connectivity, in particular by increasing the level of research and development in the sector.
The Government will not only focus on developing new technologies but it will ensure citizens and businesses can trust the outcomes of processes that the technology creates/
“Instead of focusing on the type of technology, we will focus on what consumers – households and businesses – need and want as they go about their lives where they live, work and travel in this digital age,” Bradley says.
This innovative technology will be one of the key drivers of the UK’s continued economic growth post-Brexit
This includes a greater focus on connectivity and the roll out of 5G. Bradley says the quality of connection is what matters the most, not the means of delivery.
The government’s Digital Catapult, a space for technologists and creatives, will become more data-driven, with a wider focus on cybersecurity. It will focus on connectivity through the Internet of Things and the role of 5G networks. It also aims to look more into artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, augmented, virtual and mixed reality.
READ MORE: Rise of the machines: Are robots after your job?
Rachel Aldighieri, MD at the DMA, believes that investing in AI could be the thing the nation needs to recover post-Brexit.
“This innovative technology will be one of the key drivers of the UK’s continued economic growth post-Brexit. To see this success come to fruition we need the Government’s commitment to further develop skills and infrastructure, so we welcome today’s announcement,” she explains.
The UK will implement the General Data Protection Regulation by May 2018, which will ensure a shared and higher standard of protection for consumers and their data. This follows data breach concerns from brands including Yahoo and Sports Direct.
There will be increased support for businesses in cyber security with new initiatives including two innovation centres, a Cyber 20 programme and programmes to help universities.

Bradley says the government is also working with regulators and the industry to ensure that advertising for broadband is presented more accurately and reflects the actual speeds consumers expect to receive, rather than the headline ‘up to’ speed available.
“There should not be a gap between what is promised by providers and what is experienced by the consumer,” the strategy states.
The Information Commissioner has promised to “bang the drum” to ensure the UK has free movement of data with other countries after Brexit.
And a third believe their companies will not be compliant in time for May 2018, when the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect.
Mobile World Congress: Telefónica is putting a ‘brain’ in its network as it launches AI assistant Aura, but says the company will need to transform and digitise every part of the company to take advantage of the opportunity.
Mobile World Congress: Vice founder and CEO Shane Smith says everyone is investing in platforms and not thinking about the content to “fill the pipe with” as it announces a series of deals to build global mobile content.

We round up all the latest marketing news from around the world.
Marks and Spencer (M&S) is the brand that British women have the best impression of, new figures by YouGov BrandIndex show.
The high street giant has an Impression score of +58, ahead of fellow retail favourite John Lewis on a score of +54. The rest of the top five is made up of Heinz (+53), Boots (+53) and BBC One (+51).
In terms of brands where women’s impression have improved most over the past year, Tesco comes out on top with an improvement of 13 points. Holiday operator Thomas Cook has seen the second-greatest improvement (12 points), just ahead of HSBC, WhatsApp and Channel 4’s catch-up service All4.
While M&S tops the list for those aged 34-to-54 and for the 55+, younger women prefer Ikea and Ben and Jerry’s. Swedish furniture retailer Ikea is the brand making the best impression among women aged 18-34, with a score of +57 and the rest of the top five was made up of Ben and Jerry’s (+55), Boots (+54), Heinz (+53) and YouTube (+52).
Spotify says it has reached 50 million paid subscribers, growing 25% in less than six months and extending the Swedish music streaming service’s lead over its closest rival, Apple Music.
Spotify, which is yet to post a profit, announced a major expansion in New York in February, creating hundreds of jobs.
Launched in 2008, Spotify had 40 million paid subscribers in September. Apple, which launched its music service less than two years ago, had about 20 million subscribers in December.

Remember Dove’s ‘Real Beauty’ campaign that came out in 2004 and showed ‘real women’ in its ad, stretch marks and all? Well, it’s back.
This time around, the Unilever-owned brand has partnered with photographer Mario Testino to photograph 30 women, aged between 11 and 71 from 14 countries, as part of a “campaign update”.
Naturally, the campaign involves images of everyday women with no photoshopping or major edits done to the images.
The 30 portraits will also be released online at Dove.com and will spearhead a social media campaign through Dove’s international markets. Three of the portraits will be used in print and outdoor advertising later in the year.
The campaign aims to shake up the advertising sphere once again.

Vodafone is launching what it claims to be the world’s largest programme to recruit women who have taken a career break.
The telecoms company aims to hire 1,000 people worldwide over three years — half in frontline roles such as call centres and shops and the other half in managerial positions. It hopes to tap a deep pool of skilled workers who are trying to return to work after up to a decade out of the workplace.
Vodafone’s ReConnect programme is the latest in a number of initiatives aimed at encouraging workers to resume their careers after a break.
The programme is not restricted to former Vodafone staff and is open to men as well as women. However, the company expects most of the candidates to be women, many of whom will have taken a career break to have children. The scheme will extend to 26 countries and include refreshment of skills and flexible working options.

The number of people on controversial zero hours contracts has reached a record high of 910,000.
New figures by the Office of National Statistics reveal that 110,000 more people were on contracts that do not guarantee work in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.
That’s an increase of nearly 14%, and 30% higher than 2014. In 2005, there were just 100,000 people on zero hours contracts.
Although the new figures are a record, they also reveal a sharp slowing in the rate of increase in the last six months of 2016.
The contracts can prove controversial, as they are said to not offer enough job security, provide irregular income and a lack of full employment rights.
A number of businesses have either stopped using them or reduced their use.
Homebase scrapped zero hours contracts earlier this year, while JD Wetherspoon, which runs pubs, offered thousands of staff on zero hour contracts the chance to move onto contracts which guarantee hours.

WPP chief executive Martin Sorrell has praised US President Donald Trump for his pro-business stance.
Speaking at Mobile World Congress last night (1 March), the leader of the world’s biggest ad agency described Trump as a “dramatic difference” compared to the Obama administration.
He explained: “What is dramatically clear is that whereas the Obama administration was diffident or almost dismissive of the business community, this [Trump] is an administration that is clearly from a US perspective pro-growth, pro-business and heavily engaged.
“Whatever you think of the president’s agenda over the last four weeks it has been peppered with engagement – with the manufacturing industry, the healthcare industry, retail – across the spectrum.”
According to Sorrell, the US economy “will become quite strong” over the short to medium term under Trump.

You could soon get a Big Mac delivered to your front door after McDonald’s made a filing that suggested it is looking to partner with third-party delivery services such as Deliveroo.
The filing reveals McDonald’s is currently experimenting with different delivery models and states: “One of the most significant disruptions in the restaurant business today is the rapid increase in delivery. Coupled with the explosive growth in third-party delivery companies, the landscape has created an exceptional opportunity for growth.”
The move would make good sense for McDonald’s as in its five largest markets – the US, UK, France, Germany and Canada – nearly 75% of the population live within three miles of one of its restaurants.
The filing adds: “Because of our extraordinary footprint, McDonald’s is uniquely positioned to become the global leader in delivery.”

A federal class-action lawsuit against PayPal has claimed that although it is encouraging charitable donations on its platform, the funds that are donated do not always reach the intended source.
It suggests money earmarked for specific charities through PayPal’s Giving Fund service is often redirected to completely different causes. This only happens when the charity it was meant for doesn’t have a PayPal account.
The lawsuit says smaller, local charities that aren’t PayPal-savvy are losing out majorly on donations. It claims that if a charity doesn’t set up an account within six months of receiving a donation, the funds will nearly always be redirected elsewhere.
However, PayPal has hit back at the allegations: “We are fully prepared to defend ourselves in this matter.”

In a bid to rival mobile phone operators, car maker Chevrolet has announced it will offer 4G mobile plans for drivers to use inside its cars.
The plan, which is available from 3 March and will cost $20 a month for Americans, will give subscribers access to a prepaid OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, which will be enabled by AT&T and allow unlimited data on its car’s iPad-style interface while driving.
The car giant says the move is an ‘industry first’ and is due to Wi-Fi use in its cars rising by 200% last year, with customers using a whopping four million gigabytes of data.

Uber boss Travis Kalanick has admitted he needs leadership help, after Bloomberg published a video of him arguing with one of his driver.
The video shows him sitting in the back seat of a car having a heated conversation with an Uber driver who claims he has gone “bankrupt” working for the company.
In an email and blog post to staff following the incident, Kalanick said he “must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up”. He added: “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.”

Dyson is building a giant new facility in the UK, which founder James Dyson has called “a global hub for our research and development endeavours”.
The business plans to invest £2.5bn in explore future technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics. It currently spends £7m a week on research and development.
Dyson has said the firm’s expansion plans have not been affected by the UK’s decision to leave the EU. He said: “As a company, you do what you do, you invest in your future and you carry on doing it. Brexit’s got nothing to do with it.”
As part of the expansion Dyson will look to double its workforce, hiring an additional £3,500 staff over the next few years.

Rolex has claimed the top spot in the Reputation Institute’s annual global ranking for 2017.
The brand is joined by Lego and Disney, which take second and third places respectively, followed by Canon in fourth and Google in fifth.
Other than Intel, which returns to the top 10 in eighth place after dropping out in 2016, tech brands have taken a bit of a knock. Google may be fifth but it has fallen two spots and Microsoft leaves the top 10 in 2017 after coming 11th.
Apple’s reputation has also taken a hit this year pushing the brand back 10 places to 20th. It is Samsung, however, that sees the most severe decline having fallen all the way back to 70th following a difficult year for the brand.
Both BMW Group (12th) and Daimler (27th), which owns Mercedes-Benz, drop out of three top 10.
The RepTrak ranking is based on the public’s perception of the world’s top companies measured on seven areas including products and services, innovation, leadership and performance.
L’Oréal is set to launch a store for its L’Oréal Men Expert range on eBay as part of its plan to reach one billion customers online by 2020. If successful the beauty business could roll out other brands on the site.
The online store will sell 50 products from the Men Expert skincare brand, including deodorants, moisturisers and shower gels, with products available with free shipping for most UK based customers.
Nikki Akers, ecommerce director at L’Oréal, says: “As a key strategic part of our global ambition to reach one billion online consumers by 2020, partnering with Trojan and eBay is a natural fit. The new eBay store will ensure that customers can buy our products with ease through PayPal and guaranteed assurance that they are of the highest quality and performance, this is something that is very important to us.
“The store will launch first with L’Oréal Paris Men Expert, moving forward opportunities will be explored for launching more L’Oréal brands on eBay.”
This is the first time products sourced directly from L’Oreal will be on sale on eBay. Products will be sold via the online store on ebay in the UK, as well as through the soon to launch grooming section of the eBay e-commerce site.
Snap Inc, the owner of Snapchat, will price its initial public offering when the US stock market closes this evening (1 March) with its 200 millions shares to be priced between $14 to $16.
The messaging app is targeting a valuation of between $19.5bn and $22.3bn when it lists on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, and aims to raise $3bn through the sale.
It is the highest valuation of a US tech IPO since Facebook in 2012 and the most eagerly awaited since Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba went public in 2014.
Meanwhile, Snap is also said to be developing a drone, according to reports in the New York Times, allowing users to take overhead videos and photographs, feeding visual data to the company.

Starbucks has long wanted to open a café in Italy but has until now failed to acheive that goal. However, it has now struck a deal to open its premium format ‘Starbucks Roastery’ in Milan, within walking distance of the famous Duomo.
The Italian venture is its first Roastery in Europe and fifth globally. It plans to open between 20 and 30 of the premium cafés worlwide.

Waterstones has been criticised for opening three unbranded bookstores in small English villages. Instead of featuring its brand, they have names such as ‘Southwold Books’, which critics claim give them the appearance of an independent store.
Yet CEO James Daunt has defended the move. He tells the Today programme: “If you wish to enhance the high street you need to act as an independent.”
The move comes after Waterstones has turned around its business by giving local shops control and listening to customers over what to stock.

PwC has had a difficult 24 hours after it was found to be behind the debacle at the Oscars when La La Land was named as the winner of the ‘Best Picture’ Award when it should have gone to Moonlight. The accountancy firm is responsible for counting the votes and two of its staff are the only people who know what or who has won each category. However, its system failed on Sunday (26 February) night when Warren Beaty and Faye Dunaway were given the spare ”Best Actress” envelope by mistake.
PwC has “sincerely apologised” for the error, which overshadowed the historic win by Moonlight. Yet branding experts believe that while the very public failure may impact its brand in the short term, it won’t harm its business.

Samsung Group chief Jay Y. Lee and four other executives from the South Korean tech firm are to be charged with bribery and embezzlement. Lee was arrested last week (17 February) over his alleged role in the corruption scandal involving South Korea’s President Park Geun-hye.
She is accussed of colluding with friend Choi Soon-sil to extort money from big businesses, including Samsung. The political scandal has rocked the county and, if the impeachment is upheld, would mark the first time a democratically elected leader has been thrown out of office in South Korea.
“The five [Samsung] executives will face charges including bribery, embezzlement and hiding assets overseas,” says Lee Kyu-chul, a spokesman for the special prosecutor.

Uber SVP of engineering Amit Singhal has been asked to resign becuase he did not tell the company that he left Google a year earlier due to allegations of sexual harrassment that an internal investigation found to be “credible”. According to a report in Recode, Uber says it did extensive background checks; Singhal disputed the allegations at the time and continues to do so, although he acknowledges the dispute with Google.
The revelation comes amid wider troubles at Uber. It has been under scrutiny after a former female engineer wrote a blog post where she alleged sexism and sexual harrassment, as well as issues with HR and management.
While Singhal’s dispute is not related, Uber’s CEO deemed his position untenable

Motorola Mobility, which was bought by computer business Lenovo in 2015, has launched its fifth generation Moto G smartphones at Mobile World Congress (MWC) as it looks to re-establish itself as a top player in the mobile market.
It also confirmed it will be partnering with Amazon to bring Alexa voice technology to its phones in 2017.
Talking at a press conference at MWC, Motorola’s vice-president and global product lead, Dan Dery, said: “Later this year will see deep integration of Alexa on Motorola smartphones with Alexa wake-up words. There won’t be any keys to press, no screen to unlock — you will simply talk to Alexa when the device is around.”
The new Moto G range has been designed with a focus on battery life, camera quality and sleek design, which were revealed as the most important aspects for consumers, according to the brand’s survey of 12,000 adults across nine countries.
Motorola claims the battery of the Moto G5 will last all day, with the 10W charger providing hours of power in minutes. The Moto G5 Plus, meanwhile, is fully charged in just 15 minutes giving users up to six hours of battery life.
The brand’s Global Mobile Value Index research also revealed 76% of people will pay more for a phone with a long-lasting battery, while 66% would be happy to pay more for a good quality camera. Nearly half (48%) prefer smartphones made of metal, and 50% want their phone to deliver “outstanding” photos.

Lidl has increased the volume of British goods it exports from the UK, taking advantage of the weaker pound post-Brexit.
The discount retailer has reportedly exported £300m worth of British goods, including cheese from the West Country as well as chutney and Scotch whisky to its stores across Europe.
Quoting “top company sources”, The Telegraph reveals 70% of Lidl’s produce comes from the UK meaning it is in a far better position to protect its business following Brexit, despite retail analysts suggesting it would be stung by rising import costs as a result of the weaker pound.
Lidl launched its ‘Big on quality, Lidl on price’ campaign at the beginning of the year, featuring products such as its Valley Spire cheddar cheese which it directly compares with leading brand Cathedral City.

Morrisons has extended its children’s clothing range Nutmeg to include items for women for the first time.
The supermarket chain will initially roll out the line to 50 stores across the UK. It will offer clothes including jeans and jackets in sizes ranging from 8 to 22 with prices starting from £3.
Christine Bryce, category director of clothing at Morrisons, says the business launched the collection after “listening to our customers” who said they wanted “affordable, quality clothing with real attention to detail”.
Its ‘big four’ supermarket rivals all already sell adult clothing, as do Aldi and Lidl.

Sony has sold nearly 1 million PlayStation VR headsets in the first four months since it went on sale, meaning the brand is ahead of its internal target of selling that number by mid-April, according to an interview in the New York Times.
The business had hoped to hit the 1-million mark within the first six months but it had sold 915,000 headsets by 19 February and so is on track to surpass that figure sooner.
Facebook and HTC – Sony’s main competitor in the VR headsets market – have not disclosed sales of their devices, although data from SuperData Research estimates Facebook had sold 243,000 Oculus Rift devices and HTC had sold 420,000 Vive headsets by the end of last year.
Describing scenes in Japan, Andrew House, global CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, the video game division of the Japanese electronics giant, says: “You literally have people lining up outside stores when they know stock is being replenished.”
Isabelle Tomatis, brand and hardware marketing director for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, told Marketing Week previously that VR will be a game changer. She said: “That level of immersion and intensity VR offers stretches beyond gaming and right into marketing.”

Children and young people are at the centre of a government drive to improve online safety. As part of the move, ministers will summon Facebook, Twitter and Apple, among others, to Whitehall to demand they develop new technological solutions like those used to prevent paedophiles and terrorists.
A report in The Times suggests that if social media and tech companies don’t do more to prevent cyber bullying, sexting and trolling they will face sanctions.
More than one in 10 children (13%) aged between 11 and 16 have taken a topless selfie, according to a study for the NSPCC and the children’s commissioner, and parents’ fears about sexting have now overtaken that of drinking and drug-taking. More than a 10th of young people also reported they had been victims of cyberbullying.
Firms including Hello Soda have taken steps to try and tackle the issue of cyberbullying. It created the Online Them monitoring tool to enable parents – with their child’s consent – to use social media data to see who their children are talking to. The app uses advanced text analytics and artificial intelligence to identify high-risk language, indicators of cyberbullying and adult content, and alert parents when children start interacting with a new account.

The startup wants to “take the anxiety” out of weekday lunches with a cheaper option for office workers.
One day in 2015, Mary Biggins was strolling around Wholefoods and looked at the quantities of food it was serving. She wondered: What if her favourite pie restaurant could do the same, but at scale? And with that, the idea for MealPal was born.
The startup, which launches in London this week, provides a lunch subscription service. And it has an unusual business model.
The service costs £4.79 per meal on a 12-meal plan or £4.39 per meal on a 20-meal plan. While Deliveroo and UberEATS focus on delivery, MealPal looks to change consumer behaviour by forcing them to plan ahead and order their lunch the day before.
It only allows users to pick one dish from each restaurant, and there’s no room for customisation. It is pick-up only – but consumers can jump to the front of the queue.
Nevertheless, Biggins is convinced that customers quickly get used to this unfamiliar format. The business was founded in Miami in January 2016, and has since expanded to Boston, New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco. London is the first city that MealPal has launched in outside the US.
So far, it has signed up around 125 restaurant partners in London. To build the business in the UK, the company is predominantly focused on referral based marketing and direct marketing on social platforms.
If you’re going to use UberEATS, you’re going to probably be paying £12 for your meal. It makes you feel bad for spending that much money. We make it affordable.
“We really believe people have to experience it, so they realise it can be a very good fit for them. Our biggest initial marketing cost is letting people try it for free, but it’s an extremely powerful channel for us as it offers people a great experience,” she tells Marketing Week.
When questioned on how the brand can stand out in such a saturated market place, Biggins insists that competitors such as UberEATS simply “aren’t affordable or accessible” as an every day option.
“If you’re going to use UberEATS, you’re going to probably be paying £12 for your meal. It makes you feel bad for spending that much money. We make it affordable by offering terrific meals for under £5. It’s also pretty good to get up you’re from desk and get out of the office,” she explains.
MealPal also looks to take the “anxiety” out of lunch by using artificial intelligence (AI), which recommends meals depending on people’s preferences.
“Having too much choice can lead to anxiety. We use AI so that when someone signs up, they can answer questions about their food preferences and based off that, we know what meals they’d rate favourably. It’s again about delivering the best possible consumer experience,” she concludes.
Very interesting idea, but if I am completely honest, there are too many negative aspects of this business model to successfully compete with similar companies such as UberEATS. The main reason is that MealPal forces consumers to make  a commitment that I do not believe most consumers are going to make. Consumers would have to commit to entire weeks at a time, when most people usually do not decide what they want for lunch until they are on their lunch break. While the individual meals would work out to be cheaper than those using UberEATS, the main purpose of these companies seem to be for a quick delivery service on the occasion when someone forgets their lunch or are too busy to go out and get it themselves. Therefore, I do not personally believe that people are going to commit to a meal “subscription” such as this. Additionally, the severe lack of customization options is a huge disadvantage. If you are using UberEATS, you can order exactly what you want. With MealPal, there is one meal option per restaurant. I do not know if I personally know a restaurant that I like anything from, and I do not consider myself very picky. Once again, I think a subscription-based food delivery service is interesting, but I do not trust that it has the ability to compete with the already successful UberEATS.
I am a huge fan of this concept of ordering ahead so you can go pick up your meals during any breaks you have during a busy day of work. This idea first off is beneficial because being someone who strives to eat healthy, I am going to choose something a bit better for my body if it is the day before opposed to caving in to a worse off alternative. Next, I appreciate how they want to accommodate their business to everyone with better looking prices compared to that of UberEats and other delivery services. Spending money on delivering a meal really adds up after sometime and cannot be an everyday thing for the average individual. Lastly, it is so great how they are expanding abroad to London and that it is the first city which MealPal has launched outside of the United States. This now gives people living abroad the option to pick up a meal rather than choosing another alternative. I would really love to see MealPal brought to my city because I am very curious to see how it would play out in comparison to other delivery services. It is so wonderful to see how much interest they have in the customers experience in order to make their services fit for them.

As an endless list of challenges including Brexit, tech disruption and new structures impact marketers, those that tackle transformation head on and instill it across the business will be the ones that succeed.
Close your eyes for a moment and think about the one big thing that has happened in your business environment over the past year that has directly impacted you.
Brexit and economic instability, tech disruption, being hired and fired, downsizing, new marketing and agency structures, information overload, the need for speed… the list is endless.
For the marketing industry, change has been huge.
“The defining challenge for marketing organisations in the 21st century is structural,” as an article in Forbes puts it. “It’s not about the marketing department any more, it’s about marketing at the core of the business,”
I couldn’t agree more. 2017 is, I believe, the tipping point for transformation.
With this in mind, the first Oystercatchers Club evening of 2017 tackled transformation. Some 200 UK, European and global senior marketers and agency chiefs gathered in search of inspiration and a very frank exchange of views.
On stage with me were three marketing leaders who had a transformation story to tell. Macmillan Cancer Support CEO Lynda Thomas, who has launched the charity on a root and branch transformation and Lisa Gilbert, CMO of IBM UK & Ireland, who arrived in the UK from the USA to change the shape of the marketing function of this 105-year-old company.
Also on the panel was Jon Wilkins, executive chairman of Karmarama, who sent shock waves through the industry with the recent sale to Accenture, and Simon Kingsnorth, global head of digital marketing at Citi Private Bank, who has been driving digital transformation through many companies in recent years.
READ MORE: What Accenture and Karmarama’s deal means for marketers
Much was discussed including the impact of technology, culture and shared tips for success.
Tech is a great enabler at the right time, in the right place
Technology is a crucial enabler of transformation. IBM’s Gilbert revealed that the tech firm is beginning to integrate Watson’s artificial intelligence capabilities into its media buying. But technology remains ahead of social acceptance. Consumers are growing alienated by the technology brands are using and consumer trust declines year on year.
The result? A growing trend for retro-marketing as nostalgic baby boomers long for a taste of their childhood while millennials rebel against the digital age. Consider the rise of vinyl, Kodak bringing back traditional camera film, the hostess trolley coming back into fashion.
The lesson is to return to marketing basics, understand the psychology that motivates consumers and refuse to be distracted by bright, shiny things.
Culture should take centre stage
Culture is the differentiator; and happens when no-one is looking. It’s important to have a vision and carry your people with you. Ignore internal communications at your peril if you want to engage your teams, then take them on the journey.
We use Squawks at Oystercatchers as a way to involve people in shaping the future culture and customer experience and a forum to debate issues and discuss hot topics impacting our people, clients and shareholders. By turning your team into storytellers they can convert sceptics into champions, who in turn become your strongest advocates.
Of course there are enemies to transformation. Success can breed complacency.
To keep culture strong and commitment to creativity, Wilkins of Karmarama has a manifesto. And faced with the challenge of transforming a risk averse culture to one of trust, Gilbert introduced a ‘bold and brave’ initiative encouraging celebration of epic failures as well as successes.
Don’t lose sight of the customer in the rush to innovate
The customer always comes first. Brands must stay in the mind of the consumer and so marketers must read what they read, watch what they watch and shop where they shop. Ditch the office and talk to the people who are buying your brands.
Of course there are enemies to transformation. Success can breed complacency, but hunger will bring innovation and change. Structure can be a stumbling block and businesses can fail if they take the teams who are keeping the motor running and ask them to lead transformation. The most successful companies today are building a transformation structure.
I recently met Chris Capossela, global CMO of Microsoft, who talked about five key areas the organisation considered through its transformation process – each one resonated with me, and I intend to build them into the next steps of our transformation journey at Centaur:
I welcome the pivotal year ahead. But I know that we cannot play it safe, after all, growth and comfort do not go hand in hand.
Econsultancy founder Ashley Friedlein kicks off his predictions for this year with the broad trends affecting brands and their industries.
Marketers at Argos, Microsoft and Citi Bank have their say on why brands need more than technology when undergoing a digital transformation.
As both Starbucks and Uber receive very different reactions after taking a stand in Trump matters, marketing experts weigh up whether brands should get involved.
If brands are going to innovate and win back consumer trust, then marketers need to call their agencies to account, says Robin Bonn, founder of Co:definery.

Adept at handling a high level of disruption, this year travel marketers are investing in digital, taking risks and pushing user-generated content with record breaking results.
A combination of fierce competition and digital disruption has fostered an agile test-and-learn approach to travel marketing – with record-breaking results. From adopting a risk taking mentality to developing mobile first strategies, here are four things to learn from travel marketers.
Being part of an industry that has experienced unprecedented levels of disruption over recent years, travel players have had to embrace digital transformation to remain competitive.
To serve its 120 million customers, Ryanair has invested in digital and the functionality of its app to take a mobile-first strategy. Over Christmas the airline saw a significant jump in the number of consumers opting to use its mobile platforms. Although app and smartphones would typically represent 55% of traffic, on Christmas Day this figure rocketed to 90%.
“Mobile is massive,” says Ryanair CMO Kenny Jacobs. “Over Christmas we hit over 17 million downloads of the app across Europe, which makes it the number one airline app in Europe. That gives us a great asset to monetise to other products.”
Jacobs urges marketers across the board to move faster into the digital space. “Just get on with it. Make sure you’re building in an agile way and that what you are creating now you can build on later,” he says.
“Also work harder to stand for one thing. Too many industries say ‘we want to be best on price, choice, digital, quality and service’, and I would say good luck with that pursuit. We have embraced digital faster than anybody, but we still stand for price,” adds Jacobs.
Reimagining the travel booking process with a mobile-first strategy was the plan when Virgin America launched its new app in September. The intuitive design incorporates bespoke animations and curated Spotify playlists for each destination. The app also offers a personalised 60-second booking process based on the user’s previous travel history.
Abby Lunardini, Virgin America vice-president of brand marketing and communications, believes the dramatic rise in mobile booking and trip planning is responsible for driving innovation in the travel experience.
“Given the significant growth in mobile booking we wanted to make the app a concierge during your trip, but one that also provides a seamless and super-fast booking experience,” says Lunardini.
“Our aim is to make the journey part as transformative as the travelling part and the app is an extension of that. The travel sector in general tends to be very fast paced and competitive, but it is also really experience-based, which opens up lots of creative opportunities.”
Given the shift to mobile booking it is hardly surprising that Google has claimed a large chunk of the travel space.
In September, the tech giant launched Trips, a reservation app that utilises information from the user’s Gmail account to automatically populate reservations for hotels and trips. The app is designed to complement Local Guides, a platform where users receive points for sharing interesting locations and reviews on Google Maps, which entitle them to early access to new products or events.
According to Google travel industry head Terri Scriven, the company is benefitting from the 85% of leisure travellers who use their phone as a concierge to book activities, combined with better free Wi-Fi connectivity and lower roaming charges.
“I do believe innovation has been driven by the intense competition in travel: competition for travellers’ eye balls and [the need] to make the booking [process] smoother, more convenient and hassle-free,” says Scriven.
“Travel companies have made a concerted effort to improve their mobile sites, especially over the last year as approximately a quarter to a third of travel is booked on mobile, depending on the market.
“In 2017, the expectation will be that the mobile site simply works or else they will book elsewhere. Similarly, customers have come to expect Wi-Fi connectivity like water in hotels.”
From a travel perspective, Google expects machine learning and artificial intelligence to be an important focus in 2017, when Google Assistant will be able to book travel through a smartphone, Google Allo messaging app or Google Home device.

Gone are the days of travel companies specialising in just one part of the journey. Now players keen to widen their influence are broadening their product portfolio to tap into the experience economy.
Last November, Airbnb moved beyond pure accommodation with the launch of Trips, tailor-made city tours and experiences designed by local hosts and accessed through the app.

Virgin Holidays vice-president of marketing Claire Cronin expects players across the travel sector to react to Airbnb’s move into experiences by adopting new positions within the ‘holiday journey’.
However, to manage the journey from end to end they will need to embrace digital innovation, says Cronin. She expects to see more travel companies using chatbots and artificial intelligence to manage the experience overseas 24/7.
Ryanair’s Jacobs believes the airline’s commitment to digital transformation has given it scope to move the business into package holidays, playing into the consumer trend for one-stop shopping.
The strategy for 2017 is to be like Aldi when it comes to price and choice, be like Amazon when it comes to digital and move faster than anyone else.
According to Jacobs, Ryanair has an advantage as consumers usually book flights before the rest of their holiday, giving the airline the opportunity to cross-sell accommodation, upgrades and transfers to the 100 million people who visit its website each year.
To develop an end-to-end strategy Ryanair has launched business and family products, while maintaining its low-price positioning.
“It’s about low fares, but we have knocked off the rough edges,” says Jacobs. “We have become much more acceptable as a brand of choice for business travellers and families. That improved accessibility meant it’s the right time for the Ryanair brand to start selling holidays, rooms and transport.
“The strategy for 2017 is to be like Aldi when it comes to price and choice, be like Amazon when it comes to digital and move faster than anyone else.”
Described as its ‘most ambitious brand launch’ to date, Virgin Holidays’ ‘Seize the Holiday’ campaign and record breaking live TV advert beat off 15 rivals to scoop Marketing Week’s ‘campaign of the year’ competition, as voted for by readers.
Featuring live footage of Virgin Holidays’ customers shot simultaneously across 18 holiday destinations worldwide, the advert resulted in 16.9 million Twitter impressions and 838 web searches per minute when it was broadcast during ITV’s X Factor on 10 September.
The use of live customer-generated content reflected the campaign’s focus on showcasing ordinary people doing fantastic things, explains Cronin at Virgin Holidays.
“It was a scary thing to do, but the good thing is when you work in the Virgin brand you’re encouraged to take risks and disrupt the industry. There are very few industries where you get such a level of buy-in across the board to take big risks like that.”
The risk paid off. During the screening Virgin Holidays saw the highest ever volume of traffic visiting its website in its 31-year history, which has only been equalled by its current peak trading January sale campaign.
Seize the Holiday resulted in a 15% uplift in sales year on year between September and October. Compared with the 2015 average, Virgin Holidays experienced an 8% uplift in spontaneous awareness and 6% increase in brand preference as a result of the campaign. Seize the Holiday also drove a 5% uplift in brand preference compared with the release of its ‘Unleash your Mojo’ campaign in 2013.
“We smashed all of our metrics in terms of getting more enquiries and people booking with us. We know January is the biggest booking window and so we really wanted to plant the seed in September,” explains Cronin.
“That has paid off. We have had record levels of passengers booking with us and we think post-Brexit, with all of the economic uncertainty, that is a phenomenal achievement. It’s a record in our 31-year history.”
Cronin believes the advert generated such an “unprecedented” response because it strikes a cord with consumers’ “screw it, let’s do it” attitude in the wake of the Brexit vote and Trump’s successful bid for the US presidency.
In the current climate it is more crucial than ever for marketers to be disruptive, especially in the travel sector where competition is fierce and margins are thin, says Cronin. She argues that to stand out from the pack, marketers in other sectors need to be less afraid and stop relying on using data to prove their arguments, which can dilute their ambition.
There are very few industries where you get such a level of buy-in across the board to take big risks.
“Post-recession there has been a dearth of creativity. Marketers have become afraid to take creative risks and they have become very predictable and safe in the plans they take to market because they want to create something they think will get buy-in from the chief financial officer,” she says.
“Everyone needs to put a portion of their budget behind innovation and unless you start doing a little bit of innovation and build up a ground swell for it you will never get the buy-in to take some of the bigger creative risks.”
Making the customer the hero of the story was the strategy behind Marriott International’s latest campaign, created to coincide with the hotel group’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide in September.

Primarily aimed at explaining to customers the ability to transfer Marriott Loyalty points across the group’s portfolio of 30 brands, the ‘You are Here’ campaign was shot on location with real loyalty members telling stories of their experiences at hotels across the group.
As well as longer-form online content pieces, TV adverts aired on CNN worldwide on New Year’s Eve and on other primetime slots during the autumn. Marriott also experimented with Facebook’s immersive video platform Canvas to extend the story on social media. One video showing a marine biologist loyalty member at the Ritz Carlton Grand Cayman resort rated 25% higher than the industry benchmark for time spent viewing an online video.

“Travel lends itself to storytelling and we think our members are really great storytellers to collaborate with,” says Marriott International global marketing officer Karin Timpone.
“All industries should be doing storytelling with digital innovation. Inside every destination there are hundreds of stories and travel lends itself very well to that, but it has been under-utilised in some ways.”
Going forward, Marriott has plans to greater utilise the content studio within its global marketing department to create more immersive digital storytelling. Timpone argues it is critical for marketers, regardless of sector, to test a variety of digital platforms and think about how their brand story belongs in real conversations.
“Our job is to be brave and try [things] out, but help shape how that story is told,” says Timpone. “Loyalty is one of the most powerful marketing vehicles there is and if it’s just about a transactional relationship, it will fall flat. It needs to be true loyalty, an emotion connection and that has to do with experiences.”
Whether it is embracing a risk-taking culture, taking a digital focus or becoming a storytelling brand fuelled by user-generated content, there is a lot to learn from marketers in the travel sector.
Airbnb is looking to start owning more of its users’ “end-to-end travel experience” by placing a bigger focus on its hosts and organising activities.
Virgin holidays is launching its first live ad in a bid to get more people to take long-haul holidays, as it says that Brexit has made people want their money to work harder than ever.

As it launches its Super Bowl advert, Mercedes-Benz says it is prioritising content marketing and personal interactions as part of a new brand approach.
Mercedes-Benz is seeking to reach a younger audience and respond to rapid technological change by launching a new marketing strategy based on “human-centred innovation” and “customised agencies”.
The plans were set out at a media event at the company’s headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, earlier this week. Mercedes-Benz also provided an exclusive preview of its advert for the American football Super Bowl on Sunday 5 February, which is directed by the Coen Brothers and stars Hollywood legend Peter Fonda.
The spot riffs on Easy Rider, the 1969 cult film in which Fonda made his name alongside Dennis Hopper. The premium car brand’s ad shows a group of bikers hanging out in a bar just off Route 66 in California, with ‘Born to be wild’ by Steppenwolf as the backing track. The bikers come face to face with Fonda, who subverts his Easy Rider image by driving off in a Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster, rather than a motorcycle.
The advert’s humourous tone reflects Mercedes-Benz’s new brand direction, which aims to put greater focus on people rather than product engineering. Speaking to Marketing Week, its vice-president of marketing Jens Thiemer says this more “casual” and “light-hearted” approach will help to make the brand “cooler” and more appealing to young people, as well as ensuring its relevance as connected car technology accelerates.
“The messaging approach that we will follow more and more in the future is to take direct proof points like safety, comfort and digital, and decode those to say ‘what is the benefit for the consumer – what is the human point of it?’” he explains.
“Car safety is really about trust and having a brand you can trust, so with something like artificial intelligence people are looking for data security. They want to have that trust. As the car becomes more computerised and digital, it can be de-humanising, so we are bringing the human factor back with this [marketing] approach.”
In addition to the Super Bowl advert, Mercedes-Benz unveiled a new campaign for its upcoming series of compact cars. The campaign, which uses the strapline ‘Grow Up’ and is due to go live in Spring 2017, is another attempt to target younger car buyers. It features a wide range of youth imagery, such as people partying and dating, and represents a clear move by Mercedes-Benz towards producing more of its own digital and social content.
Thiemer said that one of the pillars underpinning Mercedes-Benz’s marketing strategy is a new “customised” agency model. The company now works with three principal partners in Europe: Antoni as its lead advertising agency in Europe, Cinteo as its partner for digital solutions and content agency the Looping Studios.
The latter was hired to support Mercedes-Benz’s fledgling ‘media and content house’, which is charged with making content for the various platforms where it has a presence. Ultimately, the brand believes that content will become its primary form of marketing communications.
“Customers are interested in content, irrespective of which particular channel they use, and it is against our ability to provide this that we will be measured,” says Thiemer.
“The guiding principle for us is therefore: content marketing becomes paramount and will beat advertising. We shall be continuing to implement our strategy of building up a network of high- calibre service providers working exclusively for our brand, who will have a tailored structure and team that enable them to respond quickly to the needs of Mercedes- Benz. We see customised agencies as one of the key factors to future success in marketing.”
With the Super Bowl just over two weeks away, brands like Skittles, Snickers and Intel are gearing up for advertising’s most coveted spot.
Mercedes-Benz is planning to refit all its UK showrooms with a new corporate identity as it looks to align its online and offline branding and appeal to a new younger consumer.
Marketing Week outlines 12 trends, predictions and issues that will gain pace over the next 12 months. In part four we look at what’s next for augmented reality and virtual reality, further disruption to the agency landscape and how the diversity debate will move on.
Some 90% of advertisers aren’t happy with their current programmatic relationship, while two-thirds are uncomfortable with the conflicts created by principal trading, according to a new WFA report.

The Prime Minister’s commitment to the creative industries has been hailed as a “major step forward” but the industry has to ensure it is clear with policymakers to get the investment and support it needs.
Theresa May’s proposals for a modern industrial strategy, which aims to secure a future for Britain as a competitive global nation, was welcomed by the creative industries that will benefit from a collaboration with technology.
In her speech, the Prime Minster listed the creative sector as one of the five industries that could benefit from new ‘sector deals’ and investment in research and development – as part of a bid to “support the industries of the future where Britain has the potential to lead the world”.
The deals will offer support not only in addressing regulatory barriers to innovation and growth but also in the creation of new institutions to provide leadership, support innovation or boost skills.
The industrial strategy will also see the government invest in cutting-edge technology through the new Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, offering support for smart energy technologies, robotics and artificial intelligence and 5G mobile network technologies.
The Creative Industries Federation said the announcement is a “major step forward for a sector [that] has never been formally recognised in an industrial strategy before”.
But added that “innovation is not the sole preserve of science and tech and many new businesses are being established by science and technology coming together with the creative industries” and “investment in both digital and physical infrastructure must consider and reflect the needs of the creative sector”.
There’s an early-mover advantage to experimenting and launching innovative services while others wait and see.
Ian Barber, communications director at the Advertising Association agrees and says the “support for the creative industries is reassuring – but advertising plays a unique role, fostering competition and innovation across every sector”. He says the “onus is on ourselves to be clear with policymakers as to the value we deliver and the support we need”.
The creative industry has been given a boost in being recognised but it’s being driven by technology, which will see a “richer ecosystem”, according to Cameron Worth, founder of Internet of Things agency SharpEnd.
Worth believes it will result in a need for specialists “who can make sense of the technologies to activate” and would “love to see other specialist agencies coming to the field with other focuses”.
He says: “The investment could help develop the creative industries, the same way the creative industry had to invest in digital, the social and now mobile experience.”
The adoption of technology by brands for consumers needs to take a considered approach, according to Daryn Mason, senior director of customer experience applications at Oracle. This is despite Oracle’s research showing that, of 800 senior marketing and sales professionals across EMEA, 78% of brands expect to provide customer experiences through virtual reality in the next four years and 80% expect to serve customers through chatbots.
Mason says: “Brands will always look to experiment with new technologies. There’s an early-mover advantage to experimenting and launching innovative services while others wait and see, but they need to walk before they can run.”

Investing in innovating British industry is not only good news for businesses but necessary to be able to compete on a global platform, even though the effect and details of Britain’s exit from the European Union may not yet be clear.
“Taking advantage of smart manufacturing and the industrial Internet of Things will fuel the progress of UK industry and ensure that we can compete on a global platform,” says Martin Walder, vice-president of industry at energy management specialist, Schneider Electric.
He adds: “It’s essential that British Industry is given every opportunity to be at the leading edge of global industrial innovation through fresh investment, in order to combat the risk of stagnation.”
However, Walder believes that in order for that to happen the Government “will need to drive capital investment in new manufacturing plant technology and equipment, such as robotics, automation and artificial intelligence” – and that “research and innovation in these areas will have a direct impact on how new technology is rolled out”.
Taking advantage of smart manufacturing and the industrial Internet of Things will fuel the progress of UK industry.
Recognising the creative sector as an industry is a necessity post-Brexit, according to Alasdair Lennox, executive creative director at WPP-owned brand consultancy FITCH. He says enforcing a new industrial strategy will be essential to keeping momentum and innovation in the creative sector.

Lennox says: “Our industry has always been famed for cherishing diversity and has long valued EU funding, joint initiatives and exchange programmes all of which contribute to the island’s creative and design industry – that’s worth a staggering £71.7bn in goods and services to the economy.”
He adds: “Enforcing a new industrial strategy will be essential to keeping momentum and innovation in the creative sector.”
“Those best able to navigate the digital shift will put people at the centre of their approach,” says James Elias, former Google marketer turned chief marketing officer at education startup AVADO. “This doesn’t just mean relying on new starters or specific departments to plug the digital gaps, but making sure all staff are upskilled.”
He says the marketing industry has always been “at the forefront of digital adoption” but is at risk of being left behind “unless there is continued investment in the skills of today and tomorrow”.
However, Elias adds that it’s “not just about spending more money on training” but ensuring investment “is effective and is focused on creating the most necessary skills”.
It’s just unfortunate, then, that the EU Referendum vote Ratnerised  Brand UK. Inescapably, and no doubt forever more, we’ve repositioned ourselves in the world’s eyes with an unforgettable new proposition: “Britain hates foreigners!” Indeed, we Britons seem to hate foreigners so much that we would even ‘bet the farm’ on it (as our similarly self-destructive Anglophone cousins say) – we’re willing to risk our jobs, economy, wellbeing, even the sick old NHS we affect to love so much – in order not to have them here. But, on the positive side, ‘we’re open for business to the world’ (as long as we go to it, and it doesn’t even think about coming here). And there is also that brash new vision of becoming a global beacon of Free Trade, even if this is looking more and more like a toxic mash-up of unregulated casino capitalism, arms dealing and precarious employment.  (How do you visualise Antigua meets Chavistan, with a dash of Richard Roper entrepreneurism?)
Having spent the last three decades of my life helping to build brands (including some pretty tarnished specimens) I have to admit defeat here. ‘Brand UK’ really is now a no-hoper, taking on water like the poor old Titanic.  We didn’t just shoot ourselves in the foot last June. We blew our fucking brains out.
But there are concerns damage has already been done as 22% of agencies claim to have lost contracts and adam&eveDDB says it lost £3m in business.
As uncertainty around Brexit persists, industry bodies are advising marketers to champion customer engagement and work hard to get their priorities heard.
The latest quarterly IPA Bellwether report reveals marketers are less confident about hiring staff due to the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit.
The move will create the UK’s biggest single food business but it will also pose challenges to the Tesco brand.

Unilever’s marketing boss Keith Weed says fragmentation is a “massive risk” to brands as it lessens their power and consistency.
Unilever’s chief marketing and communications officer Keith Weed says ensuring the group’s brands show up consistently on different channels “keeps him up at night”. He sees the fragmentation of brands as “a massive risk for marketers”.
Speaking on a CNBC panel at the World Economic Forum this week alongside Publicis CEO Maurice Lévy and Salesforce CMO Lynn Vojvodich, Weed says the array of digital platforms has given brands the opportunity to use location data and target different audience segments, but has also led to increased brand fragmentation.
“People sometimes say, ‘What keeps you awake at night?’, and it’s the integration of brand. That choice is fantastic but on the other side, it’s also fragmenting our brands. I don’t want to actually optimise it for any one channel; I want to optimise the brand experience. So even if it’s 85% optimised for mobile, if it’s 110% optimised for my brand, that’s great,” he said.
“The fragmentation of brands is a massive risk, and you see it all as consumers. You see in different places that the brand isn’t quite the brand, and that is a real challenge for marketers. How do you create the power of a brand, the consistency and integration across all these different voices?”
The fragmentation of brands is a massive risk. You see in different places that the brand isn’t quite the brand, and that is a real challenge for marketers.
During the panel Weed also spoke about the company’s potential plans for combining artificial intelligence (AI) in retail outlets and admitted the FMCG giant has “a few experiments” on-the-go by partnering with startups through  the Unilever Foundry.
For its Knorr brand Unilever created an AI bot called ‘Chef Wendy’, which can send recipes to hungry consumers based on what ingredients they have at home. It also launched an in-store virtual assistant for its Signal toothpaste brand that looks to make cleaning your teeth more fun.
“When you speak to Chef Wendy, you wouldn’t know you’re speaking to a bot. It’s freaky. It’s still early days in AI, but you just go backward and forward [in terms of progress],” he explained.

Unilever says over 11 million people a year use its helplines to ask about product availability or specifications, and so Weed believes that data could also be used for further AI opportunities.
He concludes: “Being able to use that data and give people assistance, but also being able to put consumers through artificial intelligence to give them great support as well is a huge opportunity.”
If marketers think more about treating consumers as people, they will find meaningful ways to make an impact in 2017, says Unilever’s chief marketing and communications officer.

Econsultancy founder Ashley Friedlein turns his attention to the world of digital, as he continues his look at the trends that will come to fruition in the marketing industry this year.
Every year I pick out digital and marketing trends and developments which I think will shape the industry and its planning and thinking in the year ahead.
There is an increasingly blurred line between ‘digital marketing’ and ‘marketing’ but the following trends focus on the digital elements of marketing.
In part 1, I looked at broad macro trends affecting brands, and in part 2, marketing-specific trends.
Econsultancy’s recent research on ‘The New Marketing Reality’ with IBM highlights the many challenges facing digital marketing: fragmentation, complexity, challenges in understanding the customer journey, challenges with organisational and data silos, confusion around metrics and what good looks like, managing both generalist and specialist agencies and vendors at the same time, lack of capability in areas like data and customer experience, faltering attempts to be more agile, lack of clarity in strategy and leadership.
There is nothing particularly new here and there will not be in 2017. The challenges in becoming a digitally adept and mature organisation are many and will take years to work through.
This year will continue to see a mix of initiatives, which, on the one hand, deliberately create ‘elite’ digital units (McKinsey consultants talk about ‘war-room teams’) in an attempt to move at speed and, on the other hand, attempts to integrate and unify ‘digital’ and ‘traditional’ within a single marketing function. In practice most organisations will do both at the same time.
Digital will also need better ‘ops’ (see my earlier post on marketing transformation), particularly in the area of data. Ops can help corral disjointed data and wrangle the complexity of channel silos.
Digital will also be in the vanguard as organisations seek to become more agile and better at design thinking, customer experience optimisation and product management.
Non-executive directors with digital expertise will stay in great demand. There will be more chief digital officers (CDOs) but the rate of growth in this job title may have peaked.
Last year was a big year for marketing automation. Martech (marketing technology) outshone adtech (advertising technology). Companies like Oracle, Adobe and IBM went on a spending spree to acquire capabilities to bolster their martech offerings across areas including programmatic, personalisation, video and social.
The year also saw a lot of talk about using data to optimise marketing including customer insight, personalisation, automation, conversion rate optimisation, multichannel, and predictive analytics.
This year will primarily be about putting these things into action. For most, ‘marketing automation’ is, initially, just better email marketing – improved customer onboarding, retention or renewal sequences, more refined trigger-driven messaging, more personalisation, introducing lead scoring and lead nurturing. This practice is then extended into other channels as data becomes more joined up and the direct marketing of email becomes joined to the above-the-line of advertising with programmatic media.
Earlier I noted that AI will permeate all areas of marketing so is not a discipline in itself. But it will be the digital experts within the marketing function who will be expected to take the lead on how AI is adopted by organisations. Indeed, at Econsultancy we researched our subscribers to ask who is responsible for defining the role of AI-powered marketing within their organisations and 61% stated it was the marketing function.
The applications of AI in marketing for 2017 sit most obviously in the digital marketing disciplines: AI for content curation (e.g. smart recommendations); AI for customer service (particularly digital/social service); AI for content generation (e.g. email copy or video content); AI for sentiment analysis (e.g. social listening); AI for CRM (e.g. smarter loyalty or sales insights); AI for intelligent digital advertising optimisation; AI to power chatbots (e.g. for assistance in finding products or content).
As per Gartner’s Hype Cycle, 2017 sees content marketing moving through the slope of enlightenment and entering its plateau of productivity. There will be more focus on understanding return on investment, more refined approaches based on learnings to date, more focus on scaling the things that are working, more clarity on roles and capabilities.
Scott Brinker has an interesting view on what he terms the fourth wave of content marketing and I agree that 2017 will see more focus on interactive experiences beyond static content or even rich content like video.
Video, as a form of content, will still be an active area of experimentation over 2017: vertical video, shorter and longer form video, video captioning and optimisation for stream viewing, live streaming, social video ads, etc.
‘Social’ is a very broad term these days. Plenty of activity to expect in 2017 across social:
Our own Econsultancy research says that marketers are excited about virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet of things for 2017. So perhaps I will get some criticism for having the temerity to suggest these are not likely to form a significant part of an average marketer’s job this year. Unless you work for GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) that is.
But what do you think? Feel free to comment with any thoughts or links to your own digital/marketing trends and predictions for 2017.
Ashley Friedlein is the founder of Econsultancy, a sister brand of Marketing Week, and chairman of real-time data platform Ably.
Great summary of the trends. I think that many small businesses finally saw the opportunities that come with marketing automation. Tools like GetResponse or Mailchimp make it easier to start using this as a strategy.
Econsultancy founder Ashley Friedlein kicks off his predictions for this year with the broad trends affecting brands and their industries.
Byron Sharp’s focus on and commitment to law-like rules leaves him open to challenge, but where would marketing be without them?
The rise of artificial intelligence poses a threat to marketers’ roles as we know them today, but rather than be wiped out entirely those that act now will discover unexplored opportunities.
Speaking to Marketing Week at the end of last year, ITN CEO John Hardie reflected on turbulence in the news industry and why TV advertising remains essential to brands.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

Econsultancy founder Ashley Friedlein kicks off his predictions for this year with the broad trends affecting brands and their industries.
Every year I pick out digital and marketing trends and developments which I think will shape the industry and its planning and thinking in the year ahead. Here are the general industry trends that make the cut in 2017. In part 2, I’ll look at specific marketing trends, and in part 3, digital.
I believe the guiding star for marketing and digital in 2017 will be ‘focus’.
In part, this is because the economic outlook is uncertain so there is less appetite for risk and instead a desire to focus on either fixing what is not working or doubling down on what is working and scaling that. Businesses want growth, brands want saliency in a cluttered landscape, but there is not the money to ‘throw a lot at the wall and see what sticks’, so focus has to be the answer.
In part, it is also a reaction against the ever-increasing complexity and fragmentation within marketing. Both at the highest levels (what even is ‘marketing’ now; what is ‘digital’, really?) and at the tactical levels (which new emerging platforms do we now also have to manage; have we really nailed our responsive programmatic social video campaign; what are we doing about dark social and messaging?). Focus is an antidote to ambiguity and complexity.
In part, I think shareholders and boards are starting to lose patience with strategy and execution which lacks focus. There are only so many times you can say “for us digital is like changing the engines on the plane whilst still flying” or cunningly pass off what is really indecision, lack of competence or lack of operational clarity as “agile”.
In 2017 prioritisation is the top priority. Focus on the focus. So I expect to see:
2017 will be more about refinement than reinvention for most marketers. More about consolidation, embedding and stratification than diversity and fragmentation. Time to get better at ‘operationalising’ marketing in a digital age.
Take a cue from Google who have been busy cutting back projects to focus on artificial intelligence. In 2017 your hardest decisions will be about what not to do.
These are the broader trends that are shaping brands and industries through 2017 and beyond.
The democratisation of artificial intelligence (AI)
AI is the hot technology trend. But a bit like ‘big data’ I do not see it as a thing in isolation. AI will permeate all aspects of marketing and beyond. From quite specific applications like AI-powered email subject line optimisation (like Phrasee) through smart devices and right up to Samsung-acquired Viv, the ‘global brain’ and ‘intelligent interface to everything’.
AI is already powerful: Google’s DeepMind technology is winning games of Go, while Facebook’s DeepFace facial recognition is better than a human’s. But the exciting opportunity for us all is that AI is becoming democratised, becoming a utility, being made available as a service.
In 2017 you should not ‘do AI’ but you should keep on top of how AI can help make smarter things that you are already doing and make sure your suppliers and vendors are using AI to improve their services to you.
Conversational interfaces
I could have gone with bots, chat, messaging, even the ‘conversation economy’. But let us focus on conversational interfaces for now. Messaging, bots and smart home devices, like Amazon’s Echo, are the main actors on the stage of conversational user interface (UI). This is an exciting area of development, possibly even a paradigm shift.
Conversational UIs can help remove friction in a process. Before long we will expect to say “find me three of the best tents that sleep up to five people for under £300”, get a good answer, and then purchase, all by voice. Interfaces will have API access to marketplaces like eBay, Google Shopping, Amazon, etc.
From a brand point of view this conversational paradigm is also compelling. Perhaps we can have conversations like we used to with businesses and recapture some of the intimacy that technology to date has caused us to lose? Can conversational interfaces re-humanise technology?
The big question for marketers and brands in 2017 is whether you choose to play directly in this space, by creating your own chatbot for example, or whether you figure out how best to integrate in the ecosystem of much larger players e.g. building a ‘skill’ for Amazon’s Alexa platform like the Guardian.
Real-time
Building on the conversational paradigm, we should also expect experiences to become more real-time. Whether that is messaging, live customer service, live location tracking or live video streaming, we can see expectations rising for experiences that are ‘in the moment’. Just recently Google updated its ‘popular times and visit duration’ information for destinations such as shops and restaurants to include real-time information on how busy the place is.
In 2017 and beyond we need to look at how we can deliver customer experiences that are real-time, which is a challenge across technology, people and process.
Google/Facebook duopoly unchallenged
I cannot see how Google and Facebook will not continue to gain momentum. This will be aided by the focus and consolidation I described earlier. For many marketers who need to get good at a few things that they know have scale and can work, it is much easier to concentrate on a few platforms than many.
Over 2017 it will be interesting to see how the video wars play out between Google’s YouTube and Facebook, and also the degree to which brands work more directly with Google and Facebook, which threatens to relegate the importance of the agency relationship.
Consultancies and systems integrators steal share from agencies
Speaking of agency relationships, I fear agencies may increasingly lose out to the big consultancies in winning large digital and marketing transformation work. Creativity and media planning and buying may hold out best against the consultancy attack but, as media becomes more programmatically driven, it is access to (increasingly back-end) data and smart business logic that is required.
And ‘digital transformation’ is very much about change management, business strategy, data architecture, process, systems integration, cultural transformation, etc. This is home turf to consultancies, who have also been aggressively acquiring or hiring agency talent.
Identity management and authentication
We know devices are proliferating, we know we want to deliver personalised experiences across channels, we know multichannel marketing and (re)targeting can work if well executed and we know we want to measure return on investment in a properly attributed way across channels. But we also know the sensitivities around data control and privacy.
At the root of these challenges is how, if at all, we can reliably identify who someone is. And even if we can, what the legal and perception challenges are around what we then do with that knowledge. This is another reason for the rise and rise of Google and Facebook, who can address these challenges at scale and whose users are pretty much logged in all the time wherever they go online. Not a luxury most of us have.
Talent
Yes, there is still a war for that.

If there’s one thing I know, to keep all plates spinning in an ever-changing world, we have to be brave, says Gemma Greaves, CEO of The Marketing Society.

A new year brings with it the promise of starting afresh, but while it is a time to explore new opportunities marketers shouldn’t forget the basics.
January: a month where many metaphorically skip to work, emboldened by the possibility of a fresh start, armed with new found resolve to embrace change and meet challenges head on.
There has been much talk of “change” in articles published on Marketing Week this week. The site is sprinkled with analysis of seismic changes that will have huge implications on the way you work.
The portentously titled ‘Rise of the Machines: Are robots after your job’ is a fantastic exploration of how machine learning and artificial intelligence will impact marketing and marketers’ jobs. Elsewhere, a stellar cast of marketing directors discuss what the marketing team of the future looks like.
We also have the CMO of one of the world’s biggest companies, GE’s Linda Boff, discussing how it is meeting the technology-driven disruption tearing up the myriad of sectors it operates in by shaking up processes, practices and procedures in the hope of achieving what all mature companies are seemingly coveting – the agility of a startup.
As much as all articles tackle the ructions that are tearing up the marketing rulebook they also illustrate how many things have stayed exactly as they were.
Artificial intelligence and automation can add a layer of insight and drive efficiencies but they are nothing without the intuition of a marketer and can be of huge detriment to a brand if blindly used in the name of innovation without offering value to the customer.
Also, as much as there is a real need to consider the way your team is setup to meet the digitally driven changes of the future, the bigger need is to ensure your structure meets customer needs. A point made cogently by many of the marketers that gathered for the roundtable.
By way of illustration, I refer you to Boff: “It’s about the customer and serving them”, she says in explaining that despite the leaps GE has made in adopting technology, it all comes down to good old fashioned value exchange.
There are as many things that are changing as are staying the same. Be excited by both.
Should marketers fear for their jobs or embrace the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, so they can adapt now and stay relevant in the future?
Just over a year into her role as CMO at the world’s fourth largest B2B business General Electric, Linda Boff explains how her team are ripping up the rulebook and driving disruption at the ‘124-year-old startup’.
Marketing teams of tomorrow will need people who are curious, flexible and have a mix of commercial and technical skills, according to panellists at Marketing Week’s Vision 100 roundtable in partnership with Adobe.

Should marketers fear for their jobs or embrace the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, so they can adapt now and stay relevant in the future?
It has been predicted that machines will eventually overtake human intelligence thanks to the advancement of computer power and increase in data collection. But while fears that robots will one day wipe out the human race might be extreme and distant, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) does have the potential to disrupt brands and those working within them in a far more immediate way. 
So does that mean marketers jobs are at risk, and that a new way of thinking is required in order to adapt to this transformed employment market?
Programmatic buying and other automated techniques are already having a huge effect on marketing efficiency and the way the industry operates, and marketers at all levels now need to consider how AI and machine learning might affect their roles.
Marketing Week will explore the future of AI and marketing at a new event this April. To find out more, please visit supercharged.com.
As Bank of England Governor Mark Carney stated in December last year, we are “in the midst of a technological revolution” that will “destroy jobs and livelihoods well before new ones emerge”.
‘Intelligent agents’ or AI will destroy 6% of all jobs in the US by 2021, according to research by Forrester, which shows the biggest effect will be felt in transportation, logistics, customer service and consumer services. A study by Oxford University suggests the top five jobs at risk of automation are loan officers, reception and information clerks, paralegals, retail salespeople and taxi drivers and chauffeurs.
These things don’t destroy jobs, they just change what jobs are needed.
A separate study by Oxford University and Deloitte at the end of 2015 suggests that for marketers specifically the risk is less pronounced. For ‘marketing associate professionals’, it is fairly unlikely (33%) that their jobs will be automated over the next 20 years and for ‘marketing and sales directors’ it is very unlikely (1%). 
Meanwhile, a poll of 800 senior marketing and sales professionals across the EMEA region, conducted by Oracle, shows the use of emerging technologies is set to surge by 2020.
It reveals that 78% of brands expect to provide customer experiences through virtual reality in the next four years, while 80% of brands will be using chatbots for customer interactions by 2020. It also finds that 48% of brands have implemented automation technologies in sales, marketing and customer service, with another 40% planning to do so by 2020.
But rather than destroy the need for a human workforce, there is an argument that the move towards automation will simply create new and different jobs.
And as technology use grows so does the need for experts on that technology. For a marketing professional, understanding how and when to use automation tools and managing these will be a big part of the role in the future.
“These things don’t destroy jobs, they just change what jobs are needed,” says Larry Kotch, co-founder of Brainbroker – a startup aimed at helping brands blend technology and talent. Instead, he says it “pushes people into the managerial, consultative and search function rather than the implementation function”.
READ MORE: Marketers should see AI as an opportunity not a threat to their job
Brainbroker acts as a consultancy, matching the latest software-as-a-service (SaaS) and marketing tools with clients looking to use the capabilities those tools offer.
Kotch says that although “people say marketing automation is taking jobs, the sheer number of these tools is warranting consultants for the tools themselves”. Since hundreds of tools are launched each year, he says there will be a “premium on having a human tell you what you should be using based on a specific use case”.
Kotch also believes that the onus is on the people in those jobs to “get a monopoly on how [tools] work” so when the transition happens, “they are the best placed people to take that forward and pioneer new roles”.
He adds: “There’s going to be an element on shifting rather than deletion of roles. The quicker you can get on top of this world, the more likely you will profit personally.”
Tech entrepreneur Jeremy Hindle, who co-founded entry-level recruitment app Headstart together with Oxford University student Nicholas Shekerdemian, agrees and says it is “not something people should be afraid of”. He advises anyone who is nervous about the effects of AI to read up on the subject and look into improving their technical skills.
He adds: “I’m not talking about the need to be amazing at programming, [but] reading around topics so they can understand concepts and feel more comfortable and position themselves in their roles as things develop – be engaged with what is going on.”
For younger generations it is also about education, according to Avril Murphy, vice-president of sales EMEA at Neato, which designs robots for the home. She says: “We are seeing four- and five-year-olds learning how to program – that is the way forward because you are already developing the skill set.”
Yet despite the scope for professionals and knowledge workers such as marketers to adapt their roles to technology, many examples of automation and AI-based services replacing humans already exist and are making headlines, particularly in customer service functions.
So even if marketers can adopt tactics to survive the encroachment of automation onto their roles, they will still have the headache of working out where human employees are needed within the areas they are responsible for, and where these can be dispensed with in favour of AI.
Last year, Uber acquired an AI startup, as the race to launch driverless cars accelerates; Amazon tested the ‘Amazon Go’ store concept, which allows people to grab items and leave, with the products charged to their Amazon account on exit; and Starbucks let customers order a coffee via a chatbot. All are potential future replacements for tasks performed by humans.
Google Home and Amazon Echo virtual assistants also made an appearance in 2016 as part of a growing trend towards internet-connected homes. Intelligent virtual assistants provide information, add events to personal calendars, control other internet-connected services in the home such as heating, and can place orders on other websites.

The workplace upheaval that AI brings is being lauded as the fourth industrial revolution but experts warn that the upheaval and disruption could be like nothing we have seen before.
“AI and machine learning is a different beast,” says Kotch at Brainbroker. “It will be foolish to say it will follow that same trend that it did with the industrial revolution, computers and the internet.”
He says: ”It is something different and far more worrying in terms of just how much it can replace a human’s job.”
The fact AI is not yet replacing professional jobs such as marketing roles at scale means businesses and their workforces have some time to think about how their company should operate and what the jobs of the future look like. Retaining a human control element to automated processes may be one key step.
Harry Armstrong, senior researcher of technology futures at innovation foundation Nesta, focuses on researching the effects and implications of potentially disruptive technologies and believes that people can have control over how technological automation impacts jobs.
“One thing that is forgotten every time this automation conversation comes up is how much control we have on the design of jobs and the tasks within the jobs,” says Armstrong. Although repetitive jobs can be automated, the decisions affecting those processes may still require human input. He therefore advises the designing of jobs that require more task discretion rather than repetitive tasks.
When industries create totally automated systems, employees are quickly forced to conform and therefore the “narrative that we have control of, what those jobs will look like and what they do” is lost, argues Armstrong.
In some sectors a mix of automation and human interaction will be vital to how those products or services are received. It is the effect on the end result that matters the most rather than the technology, according to Rurik Bradbury, global head of research at messaging service LivePerson.
One thing that is forgotten every time this automation conversation comes up is how much control we have on the design of jobs and the tasks within the jobs.
The company believes that bots are not ready to be the primary customer service agent, meaning customer service jobs are not redundant yet but will change.
“Brands that have tried bots have forgotten that consumers don’t care [whether it’s a] bot or not, they just want to get customer service,” says Bradbury. “They treat bots the same way as an agent; they are either happy or unhappy.”
He advises a “hybrid of bots” where “you have humans behind the screen but you can scale up their effectiveness and how much they can accomplish selectively”. For example, simple tasks such as updating an address or a credit card, occasions where there is not much chance of a misunderstanding, can be done by a bot.
This gives customer service representatives the time to tackle the more open-ended or difficult problems and means customers do not have a bad experience with the bot or the human.
Headstart also requires a hybrid of machine learning and human input. The job app uses machine learning algorithms for a matching system that considers personality, interests, skills and demographic background, as well as traditional criteria such as qualifications and experience – asking students applicable questions using an AI-powered chatbot.
Hindle at Headstart says the human input on recruiting is a requirement because the algorithm learns based on how recruiters hire. He says: “That will always be the case because human factors and culture change and therefore no matter how good your machine learning algorithm gets it has to learn more – and for it to learn it has to have a positive response that it got it right.”
The majority of the disruption that AI will cause depends on how the people using AI-powered products react. Pictures of Terminator-style takeovers often accompany the headlines surrounding the use of robotics and machine-based services so there is a certain amount of fear attached.
US-based Neato sees some resistance to its robot vacuum cleaners, particularly in the UK “where [Britons] haven’t embraced the technology as much”, according to Murphy.
“The UK has the lowest penetration of dishwashers in Europe, so it could be a pride thing about not being a big deal to do your own washing up or vacuuming,” she says.
We need to do a better job of marketing and communicating because [people] have this perception and fear factor of having a robot in their home and [whether] they’re opening up their door to something that is going to be detrimental in the long term.”
AI-driven investment advisor Munnypot’s co-founder Simon Redgrove believes people will embrace its offer as they did online banking. The service was created because its founders believed existing auto-advice services were too robotic and wanted to create a more natural experience.
Consumers can use the service to answer questions about their life goals and can interact with different scenarios to understand how their finances could be affected by different decisions. “I’ve heard bad feedback and fear [about] using services like that but we are not experiencing that with ours,” says Redgrove.
He adds: “Robo-advisors have demonstrated that you can get the guidance you need; it’s subjective and not biased. People embrace it in the same way they do online banking and [it will be] interesting to look at [customer behaviour towards AI] in 12 or 18 months time.”
For those already in the jobs that are being automated, it is down to individuals to adapt to change, but also to be aware that “it’s not going to happen overnight”, Neato’s Murphy says. “Not every taxi driver in London has to fear for their job. Other opportunities are going to emerge. There will be more opportunity in manufacturing or development that will attach around automation and AI.”
Armstrong at Nesta does not believe the onus on reskilling is as straightforward. He says: “There isn’t really a clear understanding of whose responsibility it is – the industry, the state or a personal responsibility.”
He adds: “If we are about to see a big disruption or at least continued change from technology, those are the questions we need to start answering now, coming up with plans for processes and structures to deal with them.”
It is not just self-driving cars and stores without cashiers that will have an effect on job losses. The biggest problem is digital technology, according to Alex Warren, senior account manager at technology PR agency Wildfire and author of Technoutopia, which looks at the negative effects of digital disruption on society.
He says that although Google is seven times the size of General Motors, it hires less than a quarter of the number of workers; WhatsApp is worth $19bn (£15.4bn) but has 55 employees; and Instagram was worth $1bn (£811m) when Facebook bought it and had around 12 employees at the time.
The danger is that digital applications are becoming increasingly “influential in our lives” but “don’t have to play by the same rules as traditional companies,” says Warren.
He says technology companies are “not job creators but job destroyers” and are “creating a massive wealth divide of a handful of billionaires and an army of people on zero-hours contracts, working in a gig economy or not working at all”.

Warren believes that the world has got “trapped in the idea that technology is always progress – it’s technological determinism”. He adds: “[It’s] the idea that if something is new and is technology-based, it is automatically progress. We can’t stop it, there is nothing we can do about it, we just have to accept that fact.”
Technological advances will continue and while the effects of that progress are becoming clearer, the speed at which it will happen is not. Getting a clear timeline depends on breakthroughs that could happen in a couple of years or a few decades.
Armstrong at Nesta predicts a “subtle shift rather than a sudden disruption” in terms of a timeline for change.
“It may be more of a problem in the short term than the long term,” explains author Warren. “In the short term there is going to be a massive wealth divide that will happen as a result, there will be job cuts. There will be lots of cheap goods and services, which is great, but it will have a knock-on effect.”
Warren also predicts a generational divide where those growing up in a digital world will not want the jobs that are being disrupted. He says: “[Young people won’t] grow up wanting to be a driver. Obviously those jobs are going and we’re not going to miss them.”
Marketeers should embrace what we, as Ai technology advisors to a number of  major corporates,  believe will be a huge opportunity for expansion ahead.
This fourth industrial revolution of Artificial and Machine Intelligence [Ai & MiNT] will, like the previous three industrial revolutions, greatly increase the demand for creative minds and innovative thinkers. Nowhere will this be truer than in the world of marketing and all elements of the human decision making and choices surrounding the marketing mix.
With the advent of radio the creative industries boomed as that media took over from newspapers, similarly a boom occurred with television, then another boom occurred with the internet and social media. Ai will in our view present a similar boom for marketeers and the creative industries.
The winners in the opportunities ahead with Ai will be those who can rapidly understand and adapt to managing the technologies and master its power.

Individuals are concerned that robots could potentially take over their jobs. For manufacturing jobs, this is a real concern.  However for marketing related jobs, the researchers have concluded that is highly unlikely this would happen. “For ‘marketing associate professionals’, it is fairly unlikely (33%) that their jobs will be automated over the next 20 years and for ‘marketing and sales directors’ it is very unlikely (1%)” (Oxford University and Deloitte). Marketing associates use creativity in their jobs which is a function that robots today do not possess . Also managers make the final decision in many business matters which is something humans would not be comfortable delegating to a  robot or a computer.  The only people that should be worrying about getting their jobs replaced by robots or AI are the individuals that have low-skilled jobs that require physical labor or some customer service representatives.  Robots can easily perform physical automated tasks such as working in factories on assembly lines.  Computers could also be used as self checkout machines in stores and  self driving cars and taxis are in the process of being perfected.
If the robots do assume some of these jobs, that is not necessarily a bad thing for the displaced workers.  Experts  say that if there are more robots used in the future, jobs will not be replaced but they will shift. There will be more of a demand for programming jobs or other careers related to technological innovation. It is important for people to be educated in the  fields that are growing so that they can plan  their education accordingly. I also think this change in technology might push more people to pursue getting a degree  so that they would not have to worry about their jobs being replaced by robots or Artificial Intelligence. Overall, robots will continue to  be beneficial to some businesses because they help the businesses save money by cutting down on wage expense.  There is no way that this trend will be reversed, and workers have to anticipate this change.
Social data briefly touched upon in the article but let’s take sentiment for example, this is where tools have come a long way since their launch, with NLP (natural language processing) being key to improving the results, but these are still only 90% accurate. To achieve 100% accuracy the need to retrain posts and comments to the current sentiment will always be needed.
Again on the subject of language – it will be a long time before any AI can pick up nuances of sarcasm, jokes and the ever-evolving abbreviations and colloquialisms used by the likes of YouTuber/bloggers and cultural celebrities shaping the media world we live in.
Demographics in social insights will also require a human touch as more and more users of social channels chose not to divulge this information.
Lastly, the vast volume of data itself poses a “problem” which can only be solved with a human who is capable of contextualising the data: Use it to define objectives, find opportunities, address issues and ultimately guide business strategy.
AI is of course going to shape the future for roles, each role being affected in unique, challenging and exciting ways, but especially when looking at social intelligence tools, where insights are used for both guiding strategies and campaigns as well as evaluating how campaigns have performed, for us nothing beats the human touch.

Just over a year into her role as CMO at the world’s fourth largest B2B business General Electric, Linda Boff explains how her team are ripping up the rulebook and driving disruption at the ‘124-year-old startup’.
“As marketers, we have got to rip up the marketing plan because what looks really good on paper – out-of-home, social, earned media and paid media – is not the way people experience media in their lives,” states General Electric CMO Linda Boff.
“We need to think about what the new 360-degree marketing is and it needs to be redefined.”
Boff took up her current role at GE – the world’s fourth largest B2B brand according to BrandZ – just over a year ago and has spent her first 12 months fostering an agile, startup mentality aimed at giving the American industrial giant a cutting edge. This has seen the brand record podcasts, experiment with drones and broadcast on Facebook Live.
GE has gone through a period of transformation to become a digital industrial leader in healthcare, transportation and energy, says Boff, meaning the job of her marketing team is to bring that vision to life from a brand and business perspective.
“Innovation, technology and progress have been in our DNA for 124 years. We try hard to reach both core and new audiences in ways that underscore that,” she explains.
“So that might mean being first on digital platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, or the stories we tell. We are pretty disruptive in the way we approach the media. We have worked with all kinds non-traditional partners, channels and mediums.”
An early adopter of Facebook Live, last June GE ran a series called Drone Week, where a drone visited a GE factory every day for five days streaming the activity live on Facebook.
Boff’s team has also found multiple ways to use Snapchat, from filming Snapchat ‘Stories’ at its Fort Worth locomotive facility using Snap ‘Spectacles’ to creating a story from its thought leadership event Minds + Machines in San Francisco.
We do well when it comes to women at the top ranks, but in the industry in general it can get a little lonely.
Last November, GE released its latest podcast, LifeAfter, which explores artificial intelligence and what happens to our digital identities after death. This follows the hit eight-episode podcast The Message in 2015, which featured a fictional cryptologist attempting to decode a 70-year-old alien message.
Exploiting the latest trends has also meant embracing virtual reality. Last year, GE partnered with The New York Times to distribute Google Cardboard viewers, enabling more than a million readers to watch virtual reality content.

GE marketers are now exploring the potential of bots and artificial intelligence, as well as voice automation, following the release of Amazon Echo and Google Home. Boff also sees big potential for augmented reality after the stellar success this summer of mobile game Pokémon Go, combined with the general accessibility of the technology.
Whatever the platform, every marketing decision is aimed at putting a different lens on GE’s work says Boff. “We try to find ways to bring it to life, to tell that story in fresh, unexpected, human and relatable ways that don’t diminish the fact that we’re working on things like bringing electricity to a billion people around the world.”
Boff acknowledges that the challenge for a heritage brand like GE is staying relevant and reaching new audiences, particularly for a company that employs more than 300,000 people and is always on the look out for new talent.
Tackling the relevance issue head on, Boff took a disruptive approach to recruitment with the launch last year of the ‘What’s the matter with Owen?’ campaign.
Running across TV and social media, the campaign followed Owen, a fictional college graduate who has just been hired as an industrial internet developer at GE. The campaign focused on Owen explaining his new job to his baffled friends and family in a fun and human way. The campaign was a hit and in the year since launching recruitment of engineers and computer scientists has increased by 800%.
“We’re a company that does things that are complex and difficult, so finding ways to describe them in a way that’s simple and engaging is quite important,” says Boff. “We tried to do that with the Owen campaign in a way that’s memorable.”
A passionate advocate of supporting new talent, Boff hosts lunches for women in media and marketing, as well as spearheading the CMO Challenge, a pledge for CMOs to spend at least five hours a year in a classroom teaching the next generation.
Although she is proud of the number of women on the GE board, which includes vice-chair Beth Comstock who leads on new growth efforts, Boff recognises that being a female leader can sometimes be challenging.
Her career spans high level marketing roles at Citigroup, NBC iVillage and the American Museum of Natural History, before joining GE as global director of marketing communications in 2003. Boff rose to executive director of global digital marketing before taking on the role of CMO in September 2015.
“I am so proud of the women on our boards and our leadership. We do well when it comes to women at the top ranks, but in the industry in general it can get a little lonely,” she says.
“Ten years ago, GE started the annual ‘Leading and Learning’ conference for our senior women and our senior women customers from utilities to hospitals to the oil fields. It’s wonderful for women in these industries dominated by men to be among fellow women.”
The winning formula at GE is a combination of idea-led creative, a critical storytelling element, being unexpected and “unapologetically ourselves”, says Boff. She is proud of the “scrappy” attitude of her “small but mighty” global marketing team of 25 to 30 people.
“We don’t sit around saying ‘how are we going to be cool today?’, because if you work here you think the stuff we do is pretty damn cool. It’s locomotives, jet engines and wind turbines. We think we work in the candy store,” she jokes.
The marketing team is structured for speed and agility. Whereas 10 years ago a CMO would create a great message, distribute it across three or four media networks and it would be seen by 40 million people “watching Cheers or Friends”, Boff acknowledges today it is a different world.
For this reason her team is divided into three ‘labs’ – disruption, creative and performance – with the aim of putting experimentation at the heart of the business.
We don’t sit around saying ‘how are we going to be cool today?’, because if you work here you think the stuff we do is pretty damn cool.
The disruption lab is focused on future technology, platforms and entrepreneurs, while the creative lab covers media, advertising, content, sponsorship and experience. The performance lab is designed to drive results. This agile structure is aided by an open office design, which has the marketing, communications and business innovation teams sitting together.
“It’s energising and democratic, and then we try really hard as a company to embrace a spirit of agility. We refer to ourselves as a 124-year-old startup,” Boff says.
“A couple of years ago we introduced something we call ‘fast work’ and developed our own way to approach speed and agility inside GE by adapting a mindset of test and learn.”
GE also works with entrepreneurs in residence. The marketing team is currently collaborating with a digital industry commerce expert. These entrepreneurs are people who might not want a full time job at GE, but are still interested in having an impact at scale, while the marketers learn from how to move at speed.
Every effort from the way the team is structured to adopting drone technology and embracing Snapchat is focused on humanising the technology and making the GE story relevant. Boff wants her marketers to be customer-obsessed, constantly thinking about what she calls the “value exchange” of the story.
“When we talk about our storytelling, we think what’s the value exchange? Someone has given up 20 seconds or 20 minutes of their time but what are they getting in return?” she asks.
“That’s something as marketers we need to think about. Once upon a time we all said ‘content is king’, then we said ‘distribution is king’. Really it’s about the user and how we are serving him or her.”
GE Healthcare’s move to a more personalised marketing strategy and using automation to track customer behaviour may be pushing up sales but for global head of marketing operations Stephanie Meyer the change goes beyond marketing to the calibre of future recruits.

The rise of artificial intelligence poses a threat to marketers’ roles as we know them today, but rather than be wiped out entirely those that act now will discover unexplored opportunities.
Machines are coming for your jobs. While this may conjure up Terminator-esque scenes of red eyed, human shaped, robots pushing you out of your office chair the reality is far scarier. I say machines are coming for your jobs because the disruption to the way marketing professionals work is coming from machine learning rather than physical robots.
The threat is invisible to some extent – it’s in the ability to process information and complete tasks in a more efficient way than a human being can. But it doesn’t have to be scary if you break down what machine learning aims to achieve and the role we have in shaping the capability of artificial intelligence.
A machine can only perform a task based on the data inputed by a human being, the machine also has to know if it has performed the task correctly to be able to learn more.
READ MORE: Rise of the machines: Are robots after your job?
Processing huge amounts of data, or ‘big data’ as it’s more widely known, is increasingly featuring on marketers’ to do lists but what if you had the right machine to do this for you? Some brands already have systems in place so does that make the rest of a marketer’s job void or free up time to do less laborious tasks?
You need humans, again, to ensure it’s the right data that is being processed.
There are theories that the rate machines will learn will result in a super intelligence that will be to the detriment of human beings and eventually wipe out our kind, but we don’t know when or if that will happen.
Back to the present day, it’s up to marketers to gravitate towards the parts of their jobs that cannot be automated – efficiency is for machines and there’s a place for the inefficient in the creative industry because that’s where the instinct, the ideas, emotion and intuition lives.
A good measure of the risk and scale of automation can be checked in this study by researchers at Oxford University and Deloitte, which calculates the likelihood of automation by job title. For marketing associate professionals it’s not very likely (33%) that their jobs will be automated and for marketing and sales directors it’s quite unlikely (1%).
An important factor is that the development of technology will not stop; the desire to improve and to progress will be ever-present so there is no hiding from the potential changes this may bring with it.
There is no timeline for change either, machine learning could start eradicating jobs in a year, five years or in decades to come. There could be a breakthrough tomorrow, there are tech giants and brilliant scientific minds racing to launch the first truly useful AI – just look at what is coming out of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
But the fundamental point is controlling the effect on jobs. Marketers can read around the subject of artificial intelligence, automation and machine learning and be at the forefront of a business if and when any changes to their jobs might occur.
And knowing what the job entails, marketers can also have a role in the design of what parts of the profession can be done by a machine and what requires the human touch.
Should marketers fear for their jobs or embrace the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, so they can adapt now and stay relevant in the future?

The British Army has gone “beyond demographics” to target potential recruits by looking at people’s “different emotional need states”.
The British Army has launched a campaign to attract new recruits by focusing on emotional need states and personalised messaging.
The ‘This is Belonging’ campaign, created by Karmarama, looks to build on last year’s ‘Become a Better You’ campaign by focusing on the close bonds developed in Army life and the sense of belonging it can offer.
The new campaign comes after a report by the Telegraph late last year showed the Army is struggling to recruit, with the number of regular soldiers in the Army shrinking below 80,000.
The TV ads and online content showcase real stories that don’t shy away from the trials and tribulations that soldiers’ face while in the army, like tough weather conditions or physical challenges.
Meanwhile, the social and digital display activity will deliver personalised messages tailored to the aspect of belonging that will most appeal to individual audiences, like “doing something that matters”, “facing challenges” or “feeling proud”. The ad will also run across outdoor, radio and in cinemas.
“Through our quant research and segmentation we identified numerous individual motivations on why people would want to join the army. We did this by running artificial intelligence through social data and developing content around each reason,” Nick Terry, marketing director at the British Army’s recruitment agency Capita, tells Marketing Week.
As well as more traditional display advertising, the company is using social data to model people that have been successful in applying to the army before in order to identify individuals with similar traits and characteristics.
“We have gone beyond demographics and looked at people’s emotional need states as well,” he says.
“This is probably the first time we’ve taken this personalised route to such a great extent. It was very much front and centre to our thinking this time around. [This campaign] was about taking the learnings from the last couple of campaigns and trying to bring all of that together in a meaningful way.”
The campaign is aiming to transform Army recruitment from previously being TV-led to being more digital-focused. This year’s campaign also includes a mobile-first hub where potential recruits can receive personalised content depending on their interests and where they are in the recruitment process.
“It’s immersive and caters for flexible user journeys, allowing for different need states. Some people might be ready to apply there and then, others might want more reassurance and want to talk to people who are in the army already,” he explains.
While Terry acknowledges the British Army has access “to lots and lots” of data, he admits there is still a job to do in making sure it uses it correctly to target new audiences and to anticipate what’s coming next.
He concludes: “While this thinking isn’t new, we’ve tried to be more intelligent on using data, and all of our communications were developed through what the data is telling us. We’re not saying we have all the answers, but we’re trying to learn as we go to ensure we’re trying to develop our approach and continuously improve that.”
The British Army is hoping to improve public understanding of its global role through a multi-media campaign that coincides with its January recruitment push.

Salesforce’s CMO for Europe Guillaume Roques explains why senior marketers need to get inside the head of the chief information officer in order to succeed.
Salesforce CMO Guillaume Roques is the first to admit that 2016 has been a turbulent year for marketers. Even though events such as Brexit and Trump’s election victory have brought about political and economic uncertainty, he remains optimistic about the future.
“When you have turbulence you have to rethink your strategy and refocus, and that’s when you can capitalise on new opportunities,” he tells Marketing Week.
This year the cloud computing company acquired numerous companies, moving into artificial intelligence (AI), as well as deep and machine learning – all of which was shown off during its annual Dreamforce event.
Speaking to Marketing Week, Roques shares his thoughts on what is in store for marketers in 2017 and what their main challenges will be.
There is currently a convergence happening of various trends. Mobile, the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI are much more developed now – even though they have been around for years.
In the 90s you didn’t have the same amount of data available to make AI valuable for consumers. Nowadays, if you add that data to the IoT and connected devices, all that information together can provide you with a lot of insights that marketers weren’t able to have a couple of years back. The convergence of those different technologies can help you create personalised journeys for customers. All this tech is now converging so we can really reap the benefits of it.
It’s really important that the CMO also does the CIO job and vice versa due to the convergence of tech. Very often the IoT is perceived as being a technical project but it’s critical for the CMO to understand it too. It’s something they can learn a lot from and they can use to create new campaigns or ways of engaging with customers.
There are so many digital touchpoints, and as a CMO you need to understand how all these work together and how you connect the dots. You have to work very closely with the CIO, so it’s important to understand how they operate and what their constraints are. That kind of CIO-CMO synergy we will see even more in 2017 than before.
Digital transformation isn’t about how the CMO and CIO can work together to better manage those touchpoints, it’s about the CMO and CIO working together with the CEO to transform the way they are serving their customers. While before we were selling a product, we are now selling services or a customer experience. It changes the way you position your customers and how you position them within your system. For example, it’s interesting that Snapchat now calls itself a camera company. They’re saying it because they’re offering more than just a product – they’re providing a service.
Very often the Internet of Things is perceived as being a technical project, while it’s critical for the CMO to understand it too.
To connect all those separate touchpoints and create a one-on-one personalised journey is still very difficult. We have so much data available that it’s impossible for any brain to fully understand it and see what’s possible. Even if you’re a data scientist, you get support from an algorithm to make sense of the data.
Another challenge for any marketer is to define what the customer journey should be. It’s very different from what marketers were doing before. Before, marketers were thinking in terms of statistics. For example, you had your different audience groups like the under- and over-40s. Nowadays, categories are dead.
We are no longer in a world where we’re segmenting using categories such as age or location; we are in a one-on-one world where we have to talk in a personalised way to everyone. It means we’re back to where we were in the beginning of the 20th century, where people knew their customers by name. That disappeared over time, which is why we invented the different segments to help us talk to each group in a different way – we didn’t know them per se. But now that we do know them, we can target them with something specific. Marketers shouldn’t think in terms of categories anymore and that’s their main challenge.
From artificial intelligence going mainstream to brands being urged to take their philanthropic efforts more seriously, Marketing Week takes a look at some of the key talking points from Dreamforce 2016.

From ‘visual albums’ to long form releases and guerrilla tactics, musicians have raised the bar for marketing in 2016.
To cut through the sheer noise made by the global music industry takes something special. In 2016 artists and record labels alike were forced to devise innovative ways to grab their share of attention, deliberately blurring the lines between music, art, theatre and experience.
Music marketing’s new approach was perfectly epitomised by Beyoncé. The release of the American R&B star’s ‘visual album’ ‘Lemonade’ in April made the world sit up and take notice. Beyoncé first teased the prospect of new music in February with the release of the politically charged single Formation, which she performed during the Super Bowl half-time show the same month.
Next a trailer appeared inviting fans to watch a ‘world premiere’ on cable TV channel HBO on 23 April. Beyoncé also timed the release of ‘Lemonade’ to coincide with the launch of Ivy Park, her ‘athleisure’ clothing label designed in collaboration with Topshop.
When ‘Lemonade’ finally dropped it was as trailblazing and creative as the build up promised – a visual album consisting of a series of videos linked by poetry. As soon as the hour-long screening finished the album was made available on Tidal, the streaming service backed by Beyoncé’s husband Jay Z.

With her combination of artistry, theatricality and suspense strategically feeding into other lucrative revenue streams like the Ivy Park clothing line, Beyoncé not only broke the mould, she set the standard for releasing music in 2016.
And it would seem visual albums are not reserved for global superstars. Signed to Atlantic Records UK, 18-year-old Birmingham singer Mahalia created 10-track audiovisual mixtape Diary of Me in November, releasing a new track every fortnight with an accompanying video.
“It allowed her the creative freedom to tell her very specific story of growing up via audiovisual, as well as the pure audio,” explains marketing director Hannah Neaves. “It’s a great opportunity for any artist with a strong creative vision to extend their fan’s experience of their music.”
Great for generating excitement, but from a practical perspective visual albums could be seen as a bit of a luxury, says Domino Records marketing manager Brooke Salisbury.
“For many being able to hook viewers into a three-minute music video is now a tough sell. The engagement you see via news feeds and social usage of video content is often outstripping the full presentation.
“As a marketing move the visual album does feel hugely exciting, perhaps largely thanks to the surprise element. Dropping something with such gravitas makes an event out of the album, at a time when we’re constantly told that the format is done with,” she adds.

The rise of the visual album is not likely to change the way classical music is brought to market any time soon though in the opinion of James Fleury, who founded music marketing agency Nouvague last year to bridge the gap between how classical music promotes itself compared with other genres.
“One could argue that classical music has been involved in a type of visual album for decades, as it’s provided the music to thousands of films and documentaries,” Fleury notes.
“Most recently Hans Zimmer [the Hollywood composer known for his scores on The Lion King and Pirates of the Caribbean] was commissioned by the BBC to score Planet Earth 2, which could have easily had an accompanying visual album, considering the outstanding footage that was available to the BBC.”
A protracted build up to hype an album release is one way artists and record labels are teasing fans and maintaining their profile in the interim between releasing new music.
Following in the footsteps of Beyoncé, enigmatic R&B artist Frank Ocean released album ‘Blond’ in August with a carefully orchestrated sense of mystery. A month earlier Ocean had taken part in a four-day live stream on his Tumblr site showing him in a warehouse chopping wood to snippets of music.
Then a couple of days before the album went on sale, Ocean released a 45-minute visual album exclusive to Apple Music. Entitled Endless, the long form piece of music was intended to tantalise fans and build hype to a fever pitch before ‘Blond’ finally arrived on 20 August.
Ocean took an online/offline approach, distributing ‘Blond’ exclusively on Apple Music and also in pop-up shops in New York, Chicago, London and LA. The album came with a 360-page glossy magazine containing photos, interviews and exclusive lyrics penned by collaborator Kanye West.
Ocean’s distribution mix of independent record shops and streaming, combined with teasing exclusives on social media and the creation of a premium physical product typifies the evolving nature of music marketing.   
Taking a ‘top-to-bottom strategy’, Domino Records devises bespoke campaigns for each artist on its diverse roster, which spans the likes of The Last Shadow Puppets, Hot Chip and Wild Beasts. Each campaign is based on an understanding of the album, the existing fan base and potential new audiences, as well as how the artist wants to communicate and where the product sits in the current market.
The label has seen a huge rise in the appetite for special and limited edition releases in 2016, says Salisbury. “With re-issue campaigns and special products the key to success lies solely in finding the fans.
“Database messaging and Facebook are hugely reactive spaces, and with the right presentation and an element of urgency to the message – limited quantities, special pricing, signed initial runs – there’s huge sales potential from an organic standpoint.”
Having a one-dimensional strategy to push out new releases is no longer enough to impress and increasingly the lines of social media, influence and experiential are blurring.
Take Atlantic Records, which decided to thank fans of 21 Pilot ahead of the duo’s gig at London’s Alexandra Palace by asking them to submit artwork via Facebook representing what the band means to them. The chosen artwork was then showcased in 109 advertising panels at Wood Green Underground station – the closest Tube station to the venue – from 7 to 20 November, supported by integrated Snapchat geo-filters of the album lyrics and images of the duo.
Grime artist Skepta, who grew up in Tottenham, North London, explored a mixture of social media and guerrilla marketing ahead of his homecoming gig at Alexandra Palace in December. Working with music marketing agency Diabolical, Skepta put up cryptic posters around nearby Finsbury Park showing a blurred image of his face on postage stamps. He then returned at night and filmed himself spray painting the posters with details of the gig, sharing the videos on Instagram.
Arty projects are proving particularly popular in 2016, according to Kevin Graux, account director at music marketing agency Diabolical, who thinks tease and reveal campaigns generate the most excitement. 
The agency worked with indie band Bon Iver to create a mural showing artwork from its new album ‘22, A million’, which was painted on the wall outside independent record store Rough Trade in London’s Spitalfields. Initially painted without any reference to the artist, the team then added the missing details identifying Bon Iver just days before the album was released.
The more levels you can operate on the better, Graux argues. “We’re always thinking about how we can engage people at different touch points. However, sometimes it only takes one billboard, coupled with a clever idea to create international visibility across multiple platforms.”
With virtual and augmented reality set to dominate our lives in 2017, the potential impact of new technologies on the music industry is vast, particularly if they are adopted by high profile musicians.
“If the right artist – Taylor Swift level – partnered up with the right VR brand tomorrow and offered access in such a way that was undeniable to fans, this could really break a VR product and help usher in the technology,” says Salisbury.
“That said, it’s a hugely noisy market for new technologies. Wearable tech is slower to take off than we were told it would be and there’s a long way to go with adoption of streaming.”
Sometimes it only takes one billboard, coupled with a clever idea to create international visibility across multiple platforms.
Sulinna Ong, vice-president of marketing at streaming site Deezer, agrees that VR and AR are still very much in their infancy, with widespread adoption being hampered by the bandwidth required and cost involved. These disruptive technologies have, however, made music marketers more adaptable, agile and willing to experiment, she notes.

Fleury from Nouvague would like to see an institution like the BBC Proms show a commitment to embracing virtual reality and in doing so help artists or ensembles who might not otherwise be able to experiment with the technology.
“However artificial intelligence is where we’ll undoubtedly see the biggest growth next year,” he adds. “While classical music still needs to fully embrace AI-triggered recommendations, content creation and ad targeting, it’s actually new image recognition technology that I’m most excited about for 2017.
“Classical music will always remain a predominantly live industry, so there’s a host of opportunities around enhancing the live experience with visuals. I’m sure we’ll see this plugged into live film experiences.”
As the music consumption landscape shifts, Salisbury recommends music marketers in 2017 to seek to diversify their revenue streams and explore the opportunities of sync (synchronisation rights), publishing and licensing, brand partnerships and merchandise.
She also believes marketers across the board could learn more from working with the music industry. “The value of content in the marketing process remains the music industry’s biggest hook. What could other marketers learn from us? Perhaps considering what could be gained in their own space from partnering with music.”
Interesting approaches.  What do you recommend for starting a new project?  Does an enigmatic mysterious approach work in that case (i.e. revealing nothing about who is behind it, at least for a time)? Kind of like Enigma did with their album in the 90s?
Music-streaming deals with Barcelona FC and Manchester United are just the start in a ‘big shift’ in its marketing.
Spotify teamed up with Nike for its women’s 10k run events to promote the impact music can have on athletic performance and encourage more women to get running.
Heineken is launching a new global music strategy in a bid to cement itself within the live music scene. However, Heineken’s global brand communication director Anuraag Trikha admits that it faces a challenge as “people come to see the artist and not the brand”.
Understanding the role smartphones play in consumers’ path to purchase is only going to get harder as mobile ad spend rises, so what are the challenges and how can marketers look to overcome them?
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

From Coca-Cola’s new CEO facing some tough challenges to YouTube taking a more collaborative approach, we have rounded up the five stories you need to read this week.
Congratulations are in order for Coca-Cola’s chief operating officer James Quincey. Come May 2017, he will be at the helm of the world’s biggest (and let’s face it, most famous) soft drinks brand, taking over from Muhtar Kent.
This doesn’t mean he’ll get an easy ride, however. Despite Quincey’s extensive experience, he faces a number of challenges. Coca-Cola has seen global sales slide, with revenues falling from $48bn in 2012 to $44.3bn last year.
Battling the ongoing war against sugar will undoubtedly be one of Quincey’s biggest challenges. With the anti-sugar brigade growing stronger daily, Quincey will need to make Coke’s low sugar brands more compelling or think up something entirely new.
“As sweetener options are improved, the company must experiment with new lower calorie or ‘natural’ variations on its classic cola formulation that meet the needs of consumers,” urges Howard Telford, senior beverages analyst at Euromonitor International.
It seems YouTube has had a recent change of heart. Instead of wanting to compete with TV and steal away its ad dollars, it now wants to take a more collaborative approach.
This shift has come as the company claims YouTube viewing on TV has more than doubled in the last year. The rise of smart TVs means people are accessing digital platforms in their living rooms and although its likely coming from a small base that growth is interesting.
Thinkbox’s CEO Lindsey Clay has, unsurprisingly, welcomed YouTube’s new approach. Particularly as it means the two of them can now go after Facebook.
“I’m delighted that [YouTube] recognises the vital importance of TV to its success and the success of advertisers. It should always have been about ‘and’ not ‘or’ and this is a welcome turnaround. TV has an exciting future and the evidence shows that TV advertising is getting more effective – in large part thanks to its brilliant relationship with online,” she says.
Almost 100 million TV-related tweets were sent in 2016, but there was one topic that dominated the ranks – England’s catastrophic loss to Iceland in the UEFA European Championship.
The UEFA European Championship game, screened on ITV1 on 27 June, generated 2.1 million tweets from 585,000 unique authors, over a million more tweets than the next most tweeted about sporting event, the Euros clash between England and Wales earlier in the competition.
Data supplied by Kantar Media’s Twitter TV ratings tool shows sport attracted the most tweets of any TV category in the UK this year. Between 1 January and 5 December 2016, 57.3 million tweets were authored about sport, versus 42.4 million for all other TV shows including entertainment, current affairs and drama.
It is common knowledge that Black Friday isn’t John Lewis’s favourite day of the year. The company is duty bound to the American retail tradition due to its ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ price promise, meaning it has to match promotions on offer at its competitors.
And this year’s Black Friday had a big impact on the retailer’s sales. It resulted in John Lewis’s best ever week of trade in the seven days including the event, but has led to sales suffering since, especially in home technology and electricals. Here, sales were down by 8.3%, with upticks in fashion (of 2.1%) and women’s party wear (7.2%) unable to offset the decline.
Ed Connolly, fashion buying director at John Lewis, explains: “This week’s sales emphasised the different shape of trade for the Christmas period, marked by the peaks of Black Friday and the final week of December. Christmas Day falling on a Sunday this year means that customers have a full extra day shopping and are likely to leave their purchases until the last minute, as we’ve seen in previous years.”
Now that 2016 is almost over, it’s time to gaze in to our crystal ball and predict the trends for the year ahead. And for your convenience, we have divided them up into four parts.
In the wake of Brexit you might want to tighten your purse strings as there will be more price rises and retailer-supplier conflicts in 2017 (remember Marmite-gate?). Former Sainsbury’s boss Justin King said recently that supermarkets will not be able to absorb the rising cost of importing goods, while Bank of England governor Mark Carney has forecast rising inflation next year – a trend that could also affect the price of big ticket consumer goods or energy bills.
Brands are also set to work with influencers in new ways to avoid ‘influencer fatigue’. One brand already doing that is L’Oréal, which has already tiered its influencer strategy into gold, silver and bronze categories. The gold group represents bloggers with the biggest online following, while the bronze group have fewer followers or are in the early days of growing their beauty blog. L’Oréal is building relationships with these bronze influencers in anticipation that they may wield more influence in the future.
In part three of our trend predictions we explored the rise of the bots. Investment in artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to triple in 2017 according to Forrester research, as brands tap into the potential of machine learning and look to take a leading position on the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT).
Amazon and Google have already entered the fray with the launch of their connected home devices – Echo and Home – exhibiting the emerging power of voice to order services online and set personalised alerts based on users’ previous behaviour.
Lastly, 2017 is the year where the diversity debate is set to develop further. Although diversity in advertising is still a long way off being the norm, next year consumers of all shapes, sizes, abilities, genders, ethnicities and sexualities will start to see more of themselves in brand communications.
Procter & Gamble pushed forward with its #LikeAGirl diversity agenda this year, using its Always brand to encourage people to call out stereotypical gendered emojis and share ones they would like to see. And P&G’s European brand boss Sophie Blum believes diversity must be a “long-lasting investment in culture”.
Marketing Week outlines 12 trends, predictions and issues that will gain pace over the next 12 months. In part four we look at what’s next for augmented reality and virtual reality, further disruption to the agency landscape and how the diversity debate will move on.

As 2016 draws to a close, we take a look back at the predictions we made for the year and how right – or wrong – we were.
As each new year rolls around, we at Marketing Week set about gazing into our crystal ball to give marketers our predictions on what to expect in the coming 12 months. This time last year, we were expecting big things for mobile messaging and programmatic buying of outdoor media, to name but two emerging trends.
So how accurate were our predictions for 2016? Here’s a look back on what we forecast, and what came to pass.
While we may not have succeeded (yet) in our efforts to coin a name for it, it’s fair to say we knocked this prediction out of the park.
True, ‘message commerce’ hasn’t made it into the lexicon, but the concept of using messaging apps to make purchases and contact brands has exploded in recent months, with everyone from the Guardian to Starbucks launching chatbots on platforms such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Consumers can even order a Domino’s pizza via a chatbot.
READ MORE: Using messaging apps without being creepy
This time last year, brands’ interactions with customers on messaging apps were just a nascent phenomenon, with KLM and Everlane among the very few dipping their toes in the water.
But along with the rise of artificial intelligence that allows software to respond automatically to natural language, chatbots are now predicted to become mainstream marketing tools in the very near future, with many brands set to use them to accept orders and take customer feedback.
Verdict: Spot on
This prediction was partly premised on the launch of the UK’s first mobile-only bank, Atom Bank, which went ahead as planned in April 2016 – albeit in a small-scale, gradual manner with around 25,000 pre-registered customers. The bank’s 2016 annual report shows a net loss of £22.5m, but as its financial year ended in March, that doesn’t tell us much about its success or otherwise.
Judging by the app’s reviews on the App Store and Google Play, however, it seems to have had teething trouble, with an average rating below 3 out of 5 on both platforms.
Will we see this trend take off in future? The answer has to be a resounding ‘maybe’.
Uber, meanwhile, has endured a difficult year of reverses in its battles with various national regulators, including in the UK, where it was told in court that it must give its drivers employment rights that will increase its cost base. It continues to expand and grow rapidly worldwide, but with reported losses of nearly $1.3bn (£1bn) in the first half of 2016 and increasing restrictions on its business model, one wonders if it will eventually turn a profit.
One brand we cited in our article has a more promising outlook. Snapchat‘s ad revenues will reach nearly $1bn (£790m) in 2017, up from $367m (£291m) in 2016, according to estimates by eMarketer, and the image- and video-sharing app is reportedly preparing to float on the stock market, though it is not yet believed to be in profit.
With the exception of Pokémon Go, examples of the mobile-only craze catching on in the UK were few and far between, especially in more traditional brand categories. So, will we see this trend take off in future? The answer has to be a resounding ‘maybe’.
Verdict: Not quite there yet
We’re going to call this one another win for Marketing Week’s clairvoyance. Takeaway restaurants and retail brands in particular are now defined by how, when and where they deliver as much as by what they sell, thanks to a huge expansion of fulfillment options this year.
Amazon has been leading the way with its one-hour delivery service. In 2016 it has moved into delivering groceries, via a partnership with Morrisons, and takeaway food. It also launched its Dash button, which connects to WiFi and can be placed anywhere inside the home, allowing consumers to restock goods via the Amazon app with a single press.
Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s acquisition of Argos owner Home Retail Group creates a key player in both food and non-food retail with access to hundreds of new click-and-collect points and a same-day delivery network.
READ MORE: Argos wants to become the ‘destination of choice’ for homeware
That’s before we even get to all the new entrants and high-growth startups offering on-demand delivery of food and parcels such as Deliveroo, UberEATS, Jinn, Doddle, Pronto and Henchman, all of which have become more prominent presences on UK streets in the past 12 months.
There’s no doubt consumers are going to continue to demand ever greater levels of flexibility in fulfillment as the options increase. The big questions for these brands now are how much people are willing to pay for the privilege and how sustainable their current business models will be in the long term, given the huge amount of competition that has surged into the marketplace in an incredibly short time.
Verdict: Spot on
It was always optimistic to suggest this battle would be won by the end of 2016; in reality this prediction was about marketers making inroads in an ongoing struggle. The debate, as always, is still polarised, but the evidence suggests marketers haven’t taken much of a step forwards in the way they are viewed by senior management this year.
Provisional results from Marketing Week’s annual Career and Salary Survey for 2017, the full findings of which will be published in January, suggest there has been little movement in either the number of companies that have a marketer on their board or the number that treat marketing as an investment in growth.
Indeed most of the stories Marketing Week has covered on this topic in 2016 have painted a negative picture, demonstrating serious knowledge gaps and continuing struggles to prove the effectiveness of channels such as content and mobile. These reversed the more hopeful narrative of last year when marketers and CEOs seemed to be queuing up to herald a golden era of marketing influence in businesses.
One thing is for sure: if marketers want to secure a legacy for the work they have done to improve their profession’s reputation for accountability and driving growth, they cannot rest on their laurels but must keep improving their knowledge and must always make robust business cases for their investments.
Verdict: Not quite there yet
The title is more sensational that the reality – at least for now – but as predicted 2016 has been a landmark year in consumers’ relationship with data, thanks to two significant new laws that passed after much delay.
April saw the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation finally adopted into European law after more than four years’ debate – and despite Brexit it is highly likely to be retained as a statute in this country.
READ MORE: A third of marketers feel unprepared for new data laws
Then last month the UK government passed its Investigatory Powers Act, known as the ‘snooper’s charter’, which among other things will allow police and security services to hack into electronic devices and access people’s internet connection records – though not the pages viewed – without a warrant.
The former puts more limitations on how brands can process personal data, while the latter is likely to make consumers far more wary about their use of digital services – potentially pushing them towards greater use of encrypted technologies that make them harder to track online
While this prediction still has some way to run, the direction of travel is clear.
Consumers haven’t turned off the tap of personal data entirely, however as we noted in our 2016 predictions, brands have had to stop thinking of it as a business asset. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution has gone so far as to request a new opt-in from every single supporter, and won’t send direct marketing to anyone who doesn’t oblige. Apple’s refusal to give the FBI access to the locked iPhone of a suspected terrorist also shows that battle lines are being drawn on where privacy should begin and end.
Consumer concerns are only going to keep growing as long as brands remain leaky where data is concerned. Serial hacking victim TalkTalk has again been targeted in the past few weeks, with thousands of consumers’ internet router passwords potentially compromised. So while this prediction still has some way to run, the direction of travel is clear.
Verdict: Not far off
There’s no doubt progress has continued at speed in this area.
As we predicted, out-of-home advertising has been the most prominent proving ground for programmatic among ‘traditional’ media this year, with a wealth of case studies from brands including Diageo, Missing People and Minicabit utilising the emerging functionality. These followed the roll-out of Outsmart’s new data management application, Space, which categorises each digital outdoor site in the UK under a unique code number in order to facilitate online auctions.
Other traditional media have so far been slower on the uptake, although programmatic TV is starting to gain traction in the US, where eMarketer expects spending to more than double over each of the next two years from a forecast of $710m (£561m), or 1% of the TV ad market, in 2016. In the UK, programmatic has a foothold in broadcasters’ video-on-demand services and is likely to spread into the ‘long tail’ of less watched TV programmes on smaller channels.
Verdict: Not far off
We weren’t the only ones who didn’t foresee Donald Trump’s victorious campaign for the US presidency as being such a defining event, either for international affairs in general or the world of political marketing more specifically. Nor indeed was Brexit mentioned as a potential fly in the ointment for economic growth and marketing strategies in 2016 and beyond. Both events seemed less than likely this time last year.
The growth of ad blocking was perhaps the one other big marketing story absent from our predictions of agenda-setting issues, but it was a topic we had already covered extensively in 2015 and so was already well under way.
In general, though, we think we can take some satisfaction in our successful picks. Fingers crossed we score at least as well next year.
Overall verdict: More right than wrong

Marketing Week outlines 12 trends, predictions and issues that will gain pace over the next 12 months. In part three we look at what’s next for artificial intelligence, why social media needs to take responsibility and the rise of Trump tactics.
Investment in artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to triple in 2017 according to Forrester research, as brands tap into the potential of machine learning and look to take a leading position on the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT).
Amazon and Google have already entered the fray with the launch of their connected home devices – Echo and Home – exhibiting the emerging power of voice to order services online and set personalised alerts based on users’ previous behaviour.
The rise of the ‘zero user interface’, whereby people reduce their interactions with screens in favour of speaking directly to faceless machines, is set to redefine how brands communicate with consumers.
Expect to see the growing importance of AI in CRM systems following the unveiling of Salesforce’s Einstein software, which boasts predictive capabilities based on previous customer interactions.
Rapid adoption of chatbot technology will continue apace, led by Facebook’s roll-out of news feed ads that open directly into Messenger chats and hybrid products such as Google Allo, a smart messaging app with an integrated AI assistant.
The next stage will see robots breaking out of the computer and hitting the street. “I would be surprised if we didn’t see double-digit numbers of orders delivered by robots over the next couple of years,” says Just Eat CEO David Buttress.

‘Post-truth’ – the Oxford Dictionary word of 2016 – will continue to set the tone as we enter 2017. Describing an atmosphere where objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than emotion or personal belief, post-truth perfectly sums up the atmosphere in the wake of the EU referendum and US presidential election.
In a world dominated by claim and counter-claim, Facebook continues to live with the hangover of clickbait culture after being accused of allowing the unfettered spread of misinformation.

Despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vehement denial of responsibility, employees formed an unofficial task force to investigate the rise of fake news on Facebook. The introduction of a news feed clickbait detector may not be enough to convince the critics that Facebook is fake news-free.
Also under the spotlight is Google, which announced it was cutting off revenue to ‘fake news sites’ by banning these websites from advertising on its network.
The moves by Facebook and Google to clean up their act will be of interest to marketers. Digital Spy editor-in-chief Julian Linley believes that in the post-truth era it is more important than ever for advertisers to prioritise authentic content rather than rewarding sensationalised clickbait.
“Page views are valued more than the depth of engagement. That’s the opposite of the way that it should be because you can easily engage millions of people with click-bait content, but it’s really hard to then make people stay there for any length of time.”

The power of earned media, emotional messaging and stealing your rival’s oxygen are three strategic lessons to take from Donald Trump’s winning US presidential campaign.
While the nature of the Trump presidency remains an unknown quantity, the billionaire’s victory shows the stark reality that using social media to dominate the news agenda actually works.
Despite spending only $10m (£8.1m) on paid media, Trump accrued almost $2bn in earned media. His controversial claims against women, minority groups and even the media gained significant free publicity in column inches, TV reports and heated Twitter debates.
Broadcasting to more than 25 million followers on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, Trump hijacked Hillary Clinton’s airtime, receiving 40 million mentions versus Clinton’s 26 million.
The shift to earned and owned channels reflects a broader trend in brand marketing. The BBC, Aviva and Virgin Atlantic have already shifted ad spend away from TV in favour of a content-driven social approach, while Marks & Spencer is slashing budgets for big adverts, as it focuses on targeting through its Sparks card membership data.
The success of the Trump campaign also underlines the importance of connecting with people on the issues that matter to them and the demand for disruptors in a world where the appetite for anti-establishment voices is growing.
Brands should take note of the way Trump capitalised on his understanding of the audience and ability to build fame, says Nielsen head of retailer and business insights, Mike Watkins. “That is appealing to any brand where the marketing budget might be under pressure.”

Starbucks is launching a “conversational ordering system” dubbed My Starbucks Barista that will be powered by artificial intelligence.
Starbucks is launching an artificial intelligence-powered ordering system, allowing customers to place their orders via voice command or messaging interface.
The coffee brand says the new My Starbucks Barista system will deliver “unparalleled speed and convenience” and enhance customer loyalty and engagement. The feature will roll out first on iOS in limited beta in early 2017, and be made available to more iOS and Android users in subsequent releases. It is unclear when the system will come to the UK.
Besides the My Starbucks Barista, the company is also launching one-on-one personalisation in its emails and app. So far, Starbucks says its personalised e-mail reward offering, which has more than 400,000 variations, have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented email campaigns. It has also delivered personalised offers to customers directly on the homepage of the mobile app.
By early 2017, the company expects to complete the rollout of suggested selling and recommendations for additions to a customer’s order during Mobile Order and Pay checkout, which the company believes will further fuel engagement and growth.
“With Starbucks Rewards, the company’s new spend-based loyalty program, customers are finding increased value when being rewarded for bigger purchases. This enables the company to boost ticket, create greater marketing flexibility. With a 94% programme retention rate and new international markets on the horizon, the programme is stronger than ever before,” says the company in a statement.
Earlier this year, the brand’s global chief strategy office Matthew Ryan said the company’s investment in this new technology will “catch customers in the moment” so that messaging becomes more targeted and more personalised. It should also help Starbucks managed its offers and deals “more economically” he claimed.
Starbucks has invested heavily in digital technology over the last few years, launching a digital loyalty programme and services such as mobile order and pay. Johnson said loyalty remains the “cornerstone of our digital flywheel” and the company has made changes to its scheme in the US to “reward its most loyal customers” by basing rewards on how much they spend, rather than visits.
Starbucks is planning to expand its use of personalisation beyond email and into mobile as it looks to boost loyalty, increase sales and improve efficiency.
Robot hotel staff and virtual bank assistants have moved from science fiction to marketing fact, but systems that analyse customers’ data to give personalised responses must be used carefully to avoid appearing intrusive.

Facebook CMO Gary Briggs says creativity and innovation will be key to site’s success over the next 10 years but he warns that there’s no point doing something new just for the sake of it.
Why does a company with 1.79 billion users need a CMO? “It’s a question I get asked a lot at parties,” says Facebook CMO Gary Briggs. “And I get the joke, but I think it’s one of the things that makes it fascinating.”
Briggs became Facebook’s first CMO in 2013, following a succession of high-profile roles at brands including eBay, PayPal, PepsiCo and, most recently, as vice-president of consumer marketing at Google.
Despite working at the world’s largest social media company, Briggs is a staunch advocate of the fundamentals of marketing. “There’s too much of a focus on what’s new for the sake of it,” he argues. “There are things that are absolutely fundamental to communications, we just have different tools to do that now.”
Talking to Marketing Week at Web Summit last month, he added: “Looking ahead, the way the media map is evolving is somewhat, but not fully understood, while the nature of creativity and the role creativity plays in matching that is even less understood.”
READ MORE: Brand strategy, data and customer experience are marketers’ new priorities
Marketers are yet to tap into the real reasons consumers engage with content, Briggs adds, arguing that both campaigns and organisational structures need to adapt to marketing’s shift from supply to demand.
If you don’t evolve, create and innovate, then you’re not going to grow and reflect how people evolve.
Facebook came under fire recently after errors were discovered in the way it measures audience engagement. The digital giant was forced to announce a raft of updates last month after admitting errors across a range of products. Earlier this year, the social media giant was also called out for overstating how long users watch videos for by up to 80%.
READ MORE: Advertisers must become ‘militant’ over digital metrics
Errors like this are a rising concern given the digital duopoly enjoyed by Facebook and Google. However, referring to the duopoly, Briggs argues that both Facebook and Google are simply benefitting from making an early move into mobile, as well as their general ability to adapt and execute at speed.
“If you don’t evolve, create and innovate, then you’re not going to grow and reflect how people evolve,” he warns. “The way we use our devices and how we evolve using these devices will not be the same 10 years from now.”
Creating rapidly at scale is the next great challenge identified by Briggs, who argues that marketers should naturally be up for new challenges, because change has always been one of the industry’s great attractions.
Mass scale was the focus of Facebook’s latest integrated TV, digital and out-of-home campaign, unveiled in October to promote live video streaming service Facebook Live. The campaign mixed awareness building with education, showing users the steps to ‘go live’.
“Our marketing is about how you do that in a way that is entertaining and educational. A big part of it is having people see Live as for them and one of the things that was fun was using creative shot on phones for the 15-second ads and across the different outdoor executions,” Briggs explains.
“Although one of the largest advertisers on Facebook is Facebook, integrated marketing actually works, having multiple channels to reach different targets.”
Briggs admits that for a long time users were not accustomed to Facebook communicating with them, but since it started pushing out messages more broadly they have resonated well. In the weeks following the campaign launch, Live usage increased “quite well” he says, meaning Facebook will “selectively” introduce more integrated campaigns going forward.
The desire to drive speed-to-market prompted Briggs’ decision to work more closely with Facebook’s in-house agency, The Factory.
“That and because when people are inside our four walls they’re working closely with the product managers, so it’s much more of a conversational relationship and that makes a huge difference in terms of building creative at high speed. You can get more relevance if you work at speed,” Briggs adds.
However, Facebook will still work with agencies such as Wieden+Kennedy, with which it collaborated on its latest German campaign, if it does not have expertise in a particular area.
There are things that are absolutely fundamental to communications, we just have different tools now.
“We don’t pretend that we know everything. [If we don’t know something] we want to learn it fast and adapt fast,” says Briggs, who is keen to stress that Facebook is still a young business developing all the time.
One such change being faced by the social media giant is the importance of ad load to the business model. In July, Facebook CFO David Wehner revealed that the site was close to hitting its maximum number of ads on pages, which is expected to affect revenue growth after mid-2017.
The surface area of the site had become too crowded to offer a “really wonderful messaging experience”, acknowledges Briggs, which is why Facebook Messenger was launched as a separate app in 2011.
Since then Facebook has been developing its messaging technology, rolling out chat bots and introducing adverts that open directly into Facebook Messenger chats from its news feed.
Brands are now also able to send sponsored messages to consumers who have already opened a thread with them and add reference parameters to a link to determine where their chat bot traffic is coming from.
Chat bots, artificial intelligence and machine learning are all developments Facebook is pursuing, although Briggs is most impressed by the prospect of augmented reality (AR).
“One of the pieces of technology I think is coming very quickly is not only virtual reality, but AR. And we’re seeing that with Pokémon Go, which was a fascinating example,” he reflects.
“This for me was the first time I saw another world overlaid with the real world. In the days afterwards I saw how it changed behaviour. My wife and I were going for a hike in our neighbourhood and we could see kids out in the middle of the summer day running around trying to find Pokémon.”

Before the world is fully ready to adopt AR, however, Briggs recognises there are more fundamental challenges to overcome such as smartphone battery life and the fact that half the world is still offline.
“Facebook is real people connecting with one another every day. I’ve been in the business of communication for most of my career and the ability to learn, create, adapt and evolve marketing through the channel of Facebook is quite extraordinary. This is one of the best, if not the best, job I’ve ever had,” he concludes.
Facebook has been overstating a number of key measurements, but says it is working to fix the problems.
From chatbots and AI to breaking the Google and Facebook duopoly, brands at Web Summit in Lisbon ambitiously embraced tech as the cornerstone of future global growth.
Its fighting talk between social platforms, as first Snapchat and now YouTube take a dig at Facebook’s autoplay video function.
Mobile ad spend in the UK overtook online display for the first time this year, and mobile technology is evolving quickly to respond to the demand.

Marketing Week rounds up some of the best marketing campaigns of 2016 – from the most effective and most notable to those that took a forward-thinking approach to digital and new technology.
A lot of brands claim to listen to their customers but very few integrate these learnings in any concrete way. Pret A Manger, however, was keen to buck this trend. Following the results of an online poll asking the public whether it would back vegan stores, Pret turned one of its prominent central London cafés into the new Little Veggie Pop-Up concept back in April.
“A lot of brands say vote for a change, when they’ve already made up their mind. It is just lazy. If customers are good enough to give you their time, you need to listen,” said Pret’s former global marketing director Mark Palmer at the time.
Palmer admitted he expected sales to drop by 30% when it became veggie, but they actually grew. And following such strong sales, what was mean to be a summer pop-up was turned into a permanent site. 
Pret will continue to crowdsource ideas through blogs as it makes “good business sense” and has also hinted that the veggie restaurant idea could expand across the UK.
In 2016, Pret also beat Deliveroo, Facebook, Lidl and Snapchat to win ‘Brand of the Year’ at the Masters of Marketing awards. And if it continues to listen to customers and innovate, there’s no reason why more awards won’t follow.
Channel 4 was on a mission this year to showcase the Paralympics to as many different people as possible and change the stigma that surrounds disability.
To get brands involved, it launched its Superhumans Wanted competition, offering £1m worth of commercial airtime, as well as a coveted slot during the Paralympics opening ceremony in Rio, to the brand or agency that submitted the strongest campaign idea. Every ad had to prominently feature disabled talent and issues.
The winner of the competition was Mars, which fought off 90 competitors. It subsequently launched three ads with disability and diversity at their heart. The ads, which were created by Mars Chocolate and AMV BBDO, were very different from what Mars had previously created but still fitted in with its humorous ‘Look on the light side’ series.
Each ad was inspired by real-life stories from disabled people, and aimed to celebrate awkward situations from embarrassing moments with new boyfriends to behaving badly at a wedding. Through the ads, Maltesers hoped to prove that humour can be a powerful force for positive change in overcoming taboos and breaking down barriers surrounding disability.
According to Mars Chocolate UK’s vice-president of marketing Michele Oliver, the company previously “did not fully represent the diversity of the consumers who buy and enjoy its brands”.
The hope is that this campaign can be a catalyst for better representation in advertising and show marketers that by talking to a wider range of consumers they can also increase sales.
“In terms of why we hadn’t featured disability in our ads before, the honest answer is that we had not sufficiently thought about it,” admitted Oliver. “There was an unconscious acceptance [of the status quo]. This is not just true of Mars but the rest of the industry. We now want to take some steps forward.”
In September, Ted Baker launched a three-minute short film online to promote its Autumn/Winter range. The twist? Everything was fully shoppable at just a click.
Taking cinematic inspiration from the likes of James Bond, the film, which had Guy Ritchie as its executive producer, saw the leader of the appropriately titled spy agency T.E.D deploying fashionably dressed agents to prevent a global couture catastrophe.
While there’s been shoppable videos in the past, Ted Baker’s effort was surprising in both its cinematic scope and simple functionality. Most importantly it was a hit with viewers, generating 6.27 million views on YouTube plus an additional 250,000 views across Ted Baker’s Facebook and Instagram pages, plus partners Nordstrom.com and Selfridges.com.
According to Ted Baker’s global brand director Craig Smith, the shoppable film will be the first of many after “resulting in really good traction and sales. We’re in an age where consumers are almost disappointed if an ad doesn’t have some form of extra interactivity. People want to be able to shop directly from whatever it is they are hooked into.”
His boss, Ted Baker’ CEO Ray Kelvin, was even more colourful in his description of the shoppable video. He told Marketing Week: “I have wanted to do a shoppable film for the past 10 years, but it has just been about waiting for the technology to catch up. Now we have done it, watch all the rest of those fuckers run and copy.”
Watch out for the stampede.
While Paul Pogba’s £89m move to Manchester United hasn’t yet inspired his team (United are currently 11 points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea), it did inspire Adidas to produce one of the best viral campaigns of the year by effectively unveiling the transfer via a music video.
The move was meticulously planned by United, from online videos of Pogba arriving in the UK by private jet and touring the club’s training complex, to specially designed branding and photography of the player. The hashtags #POGBACK and #ReUnited also signified the return of Pogba to a club that had sold him back in 2012. The highlight, however, was a viral music video by kit sponsor Adidas.
It featured Pogba dancing to a track – which painted the French international footballer as some sort of dabbing superhero – by British grime rapper Stormzy. The video cutting the two together to look like they were having the time of their lives.
According to Adidas’ director of sports performance Ben Goldhagen, the music video represents a permanent shift. He says high-profile football transfers now present a profitable opportunity for sponsors to align players with social media influencers.
Goldhagen explains: “This is definitely indicative of how we would like to activate these transfer moments moving forward – combining the best of our social influencer audience with our players in content that is edited in such a way [as] to showcase them side by side in the eyes of the audience.”
In the four days following Pogba’s move there were 153,000 social media mentions of the transfer, according to Brandwatch. This compared to just 38,000 mentions of Manchester City’s big budget move for Everton defender John Stones.
Don’t be surprised if Manchester City give Stormzy a call ahead of the January transfer window.
Malibu brought the the internet of things to FMCG this year as the company tapped into “contactless payment behaviour” for its summer campaign #BecauseSummer.
It was a first for the innovative beverage brand and for the sector, as the company created 45,000 connected bottles that allowed iPhone and Android users to access exclusive content, including prize draws, drinks recipes, playlists and a bar locator.
Users did not have to download or open an app to connect with the brand, they just had to tap the ‘sunset’ logo on the Malibu bottle.
The move followed work undertaken at The Absolut Company’s innovation lab in Stockholm, which, like Malibu, is owned by Pernod Ricard. It was introduced after research by Malibu found consumers are increasingly looking to buy “experience and not products”.
“This is not a PR stunt. Success isn’t necessarily about the numbers, it’s very much about gaining exclusive insight on how consumers react to new tech and exploring the boundaries of where technology can go,” says Jo Alexander, Malibu marketing manager, Pernod Ricard UK.
Following the success of this year’s campaign, Malibu is set to roll out Coco-nect cups commercially in summer 2017  allowing concert and festival goers to order and pay for drinks without having to queue at the bar. The aim of the venture is to “banish British queuing tradition”, by sending signals to bar staff every time a fresh drink is required.
Brands are under increasing pressure to find more inventive ways to reach their target audience. And with younger generations moving from TV to online, the use of influencers, who boast huge followings on social media, seem to be a popular option among brands.
But L’Oréal believes its competitors are not approaching it in the right way. And so in September it announced it was signing up five British beauty bloggers to create content on an ongoing basis. Through this, it is hoping to “craft a different type of relationship” when it comes to working with influencers.
The beauty giant’s UK general manager Adrien Koskas told Marketing Week at the time that it was not interested in a “one post one cheque” type of relationship; instead, it wants to form long-term partnerships.
“Consumers will walk away from influencers that have been bought by brands, where there is no story behind it or are doing just one-offs. It depends on us being the biggest beauty brand in the UK to craft a different kind of relationship. When it comes to influencers, we want to shift the industry towards something that is more genuine,” he said.
“I know they will continue to talk about other brands too, or sometimes be more critical. So I’m pretty confident and this is an open discussion with them – they keep their freedom and editorial point-of-view,” he said.
The beauty company also featured the first ever male influencer in one of its campaigns in August. Blogger and makeup artist Gary, aka ‘The Plastic Boy’, has been chosen to reflect the fact that more men are wearing makeup.
While a dirty roof probably doesn’t sound like the best idea for a clever experiential campaign, it proved to be just that for the O2 Arena. Realising the North Greenwich venue hadn’t cleaned its roof since 2007, AEG, which works on the O2’s sponsorship deals, approached Unilever’s cleaning brand CIF.
And over a 12-week period, CIF hired cleaners to thoroughly wash the roof, with daily social media videos updating their progress and signage around the O2 promoting the campaign with the slogan: “While you raise the roof, we are cleaning it”.
Gemma Cleland, Unilever’s executive director of homecare, says the campaign exposed CIF to a new type of customer and that the FMCG giant will now bring more of its brands to life at the venue.
“We’ve already had one million views of The O2 clean on our social channels and it is broadening our audience. Being there can expose you to a completely different demographic,” she said speaking at the time.
And for The O2 Arena itself, the campaign helped to generate income and brand salience from the most unlikeliest of locations; a filthy roof. “The O2 arena isn’t just about coming to see Adele but about unconventional marketing too. Moving forward, this will be a big part of our sponsorship strategy and we’ll try to use all our space effectively,” says Nathan Kosky, VP of global partnerships at AEG.
We just hope he doesn’t mean the toilets.
2016 was the year artificial intelligence finally made it into the marketing mainstream, mostly through the use of chatbots on Facebook Messenger. And UKTV came up with a clever way of using them.
The first campaign for its on-demand TV service UK Play used the chatbots to serve up personalised show recommendations in a bid to position the brand as a “disruptive” entertainment service. So if someone said they wanted to laugh UK Play could suggest Big Bang Theory, or if they wanted entertaining it could suggest The X Factor (if that’s your thing).
Zoe Clapp, UKTV’s chief marketing and communications officer, says: “Being presented with thousands of shows on an on-demand service can be time consuming at a moment when you just want to relax and be entertained. The idea behind the Facebook Messenger chatbot is to create an accessible and guiding expert for viewers looking for something great to watch.”

UKTV wasn’t the only brand to come up with a novel way to make use of chatbots. Domino’s launched a bot, called @DOMThePizzBot, that allows customers to place an order simply by typing ‘pizza’ into Facebook Messenger. Created by We Are Social and TalkBe, it would then offer people a range of different toppings, bases and sizes.
Expect more chatbots to appear in advertising campaigns next year as brands push the envelope on what is considered helpful and just plain creepy.
Marketing Week rounds up some of the best marketing campaigns of 2016 – from the most effective and most notable to those that took a forward-thinking approach to digital and new technology.
From Tesco’s comeback to Team GB striking gold at the Rio Olympics, here are five of the biggest marketing success stories from 2016.

From Samsung’s exploding phones to scrutiny of media agencies and the incoming sugar tax, 2016 was a difficult year for a number of brands and sectors.
Disney has four brand partners for the launch of Star Wars: Rogue One and is confident the film’s marketing can build on previous successes.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

Children’s internet use has hit a record high, according to new Ofcom figures, but with so much of the content they consume being regulated, media owners face growing expectations to take responsibility for kids’ online safety
Children face many online dangers – including pornography, sexual grooming and trolls – and the threat is growing thanks to their evolving digital behaviour. They are spending more time online, tablet and smartphone ownership is on the rise, and kids’ digital capabilities are outpacing those of parents and carers, who often feel ill-equipped to advise.
Although many digital content and service providers are now expected to help parents, charities and teachers to deal with these issues, brands and social platforms are also beginning to be held accountable. But the balance between parental control and empowering children to make informed choices has prompted them to take vastly different approaches.
Children’s internet use has reached record highs, according to Ofcom data published last month. Children aged five to 15 spend around 15 hours each week online, overtaking time spent watching a TV set for the first time. Pre-schoolers aged three to four spend eight hours and 18 minutes a week online, up an hour and a half since last year.
Ofcom’s report also shows that YouTube is one of the most popular online destinations, with 73% of those aged five to 15 using the video site and 37% of pre-schoolers regularly watching. The minimum age for YouTube is 13, though the platform has a downloadable kids’ app.
The popularity of the channel, and of vloggers, can be an advantage in reaching children with safety-related messages. For example, children’s charity the NSPCC and agency Livity created a series of vlogger-voiced YouTube animations called ‘Fight Against Porn Zombies’ (FAPZ) to remove the embarrassment and shame associated with discussing issues around porn, directing them to Childline as a source of support.
Research by the NSPCC, the Office of the Children’s Commissioner and Middlesex University found over half of children aged 11 to 16 have been exposed to online pornography, with almost all (94%) having seen it by age 14. They are as likely to have been inadvertently exposed to pornography, for example via a pop-up ad, as to have actively searched for it.
“We know that YouTubers have a huge following with our audience so their involvement [in FAPZ] substantially increased the reach and drove more young people to view the content and supporting information,” says Julia Fossi, head of child online safety, public affairs and policy at the NSPCC.
“It has incomparable usage rates to other video platforms and we wanted this campaign to exist in the spaces where young people are. We also know that a lot of self-generated porn is shared on social platforms, so it’s logical to carry out this campaign in a social space where teens may be exposed to explicit imagery.”
Since FAPZ, the charity has developed a ‘Listen to Your Selfie’ campaign, which launched in September. It focuses on grooming and child sex exploitation, with surrounding content on unhealthy relationship behaviours.
The campaign features two online films, one focusing on an online gaming scenario where a 14-year-old boy is groomed by an older male. The film signposts to supporting advice on Childline and features promoted content on Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook.

“Children no longer relate to the phrase ‘online lives’ – we say it but they don’t,” according to Children’s Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield. “That distinction doesn’t exist, as near-constant digital engagement has become their norm.”
This reality prompted the launch of 5Rights, an international initiative that lays out five principles stating children’s digital rights. They include the right to easily edit or delete all content they have created and the right to know who is holding or profiting from their information, what their information is being used for and whether it is being copied, sold or traded.
The initiative says children and young people should be confident that they will be protected from illegal practices and supported if confronted by troubling or upsetting scenarios online. It also states that they should be empowered to reach into creative places but with the capacity and support to easily disengage, and that they need to be taught the skills to use, create and critique digital technologies.
Longfield polled children about their digital rights and says 63% “had no idea what their digital rights were and 81% wanted more help understanding them or more knowledge of what they should expect as [internet] users”.
Solutions devised to help manage the risks that are faced in the online world must be done in partnership with children.
The research also showed that 88% did not know what information is outlined in terms and conditions and never read them. Longfield is therefore looking at introducing a “rights-friendly, easily understood model of terms and conditions to the industry – this framework has been built by expert lawyers and is not only easily understandable, but retains its legal functionality”. This is so young people know “what they sign up to every time they click that button, what rights they have and what rights they give away”.
Speaking at a Westminster Education Forum event on technology, child development, 5Rights and policy, Longfield said: “We want children to be confident creators and managers of their online time, this is one of the most pressing social issues of our time. Protecting children is a shared responsibility in which parents, carers, governments, policy makers, educators and, importantly, industry, all have a vital role to play.”
As children spend more of their time online, the awareness of advertising and vlogger endorsements has also increased, according to the Ofcom study, as more than half of internet users aged 12 to 15 (55%) are now aware that online advertising can be personalised – up 10 percentage points in the past year. In addition, the age group’s awareness of product endorsement from vloggers has also increased by 10 percentage points to 57% in 2016.
However, many children still need help to identify advertising on Google’s search pages, with only a minority of eight- to 11-year-olds (24%) and 12- to 15-year-olds (38%) correctly recognising sponsored links.
Marc Goodchild, chief product officer at kids content creator Gingersnap and executive advisor at The Children’s Media Foundation, expressed concern at the Westminster Education Forum over a status quo “where there is no accountability and no transparency”.
He believes the online world is reaching a “turning point” where “technological oligarchs” have created “consolidation in the industry and there are fewer platforms that are controlling what children access, where and how they access it”.
Goodchild says: “Children even up to the age of 15 are unskilled at being able to spot an advert on Google, and when asked most of them don’t know the difference between a placed ad in search and an organic entry.”
He adds: “We have digital experts in their thousands coming up with very clever algorithms to improve the monetisation and stickiness of these platforms to make sure that anyone making stuff can turn data into money. If only a fraction of that money was used to make the internet more age-appropriate by design, you would have a much better device.”
Building online safety into the design of a service is the route Sky took with its digital safety strategy, breaking it down into three strands including filters, education and products.
Sky Broadband Shield is a network-level filter for content across all devices using Sky’s services in the home, but the company decided to turn this on by default because the take-up rates in homes is 62%, compared to an opt-in model where it would be closer to 10%.
Sky also backs Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to help keep children safe in the digital world, together with BT, TalkTalk and Virgin Media. Google and the BBC joined in April this year.
Joining Goodchild at the Westminster Education Forum, director of policy at Sky, Adam Kinsley, told delegates that it is important to design products for children right from the start.
Kids want to discover, they are curious and don’t want to be told what they can watch.
The Sky Kids app is a curated walled garden of age-appropriate content, built to ensure that children can enjoy content in a safe way. It includes age profiling where up to 10 users can specify those details, children can build an avatar, there is a bedtime mode and there are no ads.
Kinsley says children were involved in the design of the app. He explains: “The user interface was put in front of a panel of children and we were keen that this was an app that they could discover content in.” It also offers autoplay features, where the app gives you content automatically once a piece of content is finished.
He says: “As a content company, that is neat because you can get [kids] to look at content that you invest a lot of money in. Parents [had] mixed views about it, but when we put it in front of children they hated it. They want to discover, they are curious and don’t want to be told what they can watch.”
Fossi at the NSPCC agrees with this approach. She says: “Children and young people are experts in their experiences online – and as such, any solutions devised to help manage the risks that are faced in the online world must be done in partnership with young people themselves.”
Internet Matters released a study, titled Pace of Change, that shows 48% of parents believe their children know more about the internet than they do and 78% of children agree. It also shows that children spend significantly longer on the internet than their parents, and twice as long on social media.
In 2014, O2 began to notice that online child safety was becoming a big concern among parents and more widely among customers, as coverage of child sex abuses dominated the media.
Bill Eyres, head of sustainability at O2, says the brand “stepped back” and looked at what it could do to support customers and insight showed that “parents were struggling because kids are so far ahead of them in the digital world and they need more support”.
That insight saw O2 partner with the NSPCC. Eyres says: “The biggest gap in the market we saw was human-to-human advice. There’s lots of content online but what parents wanted was the ability to get tailored advice. That is why we developed the free helpline, which isn’t just for customers but available to anyone.”

It was important for O2 to integrate the approach into the core of the business and office and retail staff are trained in online safety. It launched a kids tablet that offered a walled garden of content and included it in its ‘More for You’ brand campaign.
The Ofcom study backs O2’s approach. It shows that conversations are an important part of keeping children safe online. Nine in 10 children aged eight to 15 have had conversations with parents or teachers about being safe online, according to the research, and would tell someone if they saw something they found worrying or nasty.
Parents of older children are most likely to be having these types of conversations with their children, with 92% of parents of 12- to 15-year-olds saying they have spoken to their child about online safety, an increase of six percentage points since 2015.
Eyres says: “Our first year [in online safety] was driving awareness of the issues and the need to have conversations. Now we are naturally moving into behaviour change. The biggest thing is about behaviour change, [it] is about helping parents have regular high-quality conversations with their children about online safety.”
Results from O2’s brand campaign show that seven in 10 parents had a conversation with kids as a result of its advertising and consumers felt warmer towards O2 after seeing the campaign.
Nearly all parents (96%) of five- to 15-year-olds  manage their children’s internet use in some way – through technical tools, talking to or supervising their child, or setting rules about access to the internet and online behaviour. Two in five parents used all four approaches.
App creators are also involving parents in the process of shaping brands for kids and these are even made with parent control in mind. Hopster, a UK TV and learning tablet app for children aged two to six, provides tools for parents to monitor usage.
Working with video platform Ooyala, it reinvents kids’ TV channels by combining shows with an ad-free educational curriculum and gaming that can be personalised, and uses technology to help reassure parents that their kids are in the right environment.
Nick Walters, founder and CEO at Hopster, says: “We have reports on a monthly basis on what they have learnt and discovered – and we provide tools. We have a feature that allows them to set a defined amount of time to spend in front of the TV and after that the TV shuts down.”
Walters adds: “One of the great things about a digital product is that you are in constant communication with your users. You get app reviews and emails and we also run a private social network for our most engaged users, who not only feed back on the product as it is today, but share ideas and thoughts in real time about where we should be taking the product.”
A raft of apps are appearing that aim to alleviate some of the online safety issues around social media sites, even though the age limit for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube is 13.
Online Them, a monitoring tool created by Hello Soda, enables parents – with their child’s consent – to use social media data to see who their children are talking to. The app uses advanced text analytics and artificial intelligence to identify high-risk language, indicators of cyberbullying and adult content, and alert parents when children start interacting with a new account.
“The tool builds trust between a parent and their child, as the parent requires consent from the child in order to access their data,” says James Blake, CEO at Hello Soda. “While steps are being taken to make the internet safer for children, the content that young people consume online is largely unregulated. It’s difficult for parents to know who exactly their children are talking to, or whether they’re being exposed to adult content or cyberbullying. These kind of tools will help to build a safer online community for all young people.”
Another example is recently launched app Oyoty, which is designed to make children more aware of what they are sharing online by singling out content that is personal or inappropriate as soon as it is posted on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.
Founder, Deepak Tewari, says the age limit on social media is “the big elephant in the room”. He says: “According to a study done by the BBC last year, more than 70% of kids under the age of 12 have social media accounts. This is part of the reason why [the Oyoty app was developed]. There are a whole bunch of kids using social media either without authorisation or training.”
Using artificial intelligence, it starts a conversation with the child and guides them through the process of editing or removing content, as well as educating them about what they should or should not be posting.
Tewari adds: “We did a lot of work to make sure we are a friend of the child and non-judgemental. [Users] are welcome to post or disregard what the app is telling them but it just [makes a] suggestion in a fun way to make it light. [We also] worked with a child psychologist on the language to make sure conversations were not condescending, or big brother-like.”
The future of the app is in the technology. Tewari would like to expand to multiple languages and functions, for example adding in sensors for grooming or self-harming. Involving the child is also vital. Tewari says: “The technology is strong – but to reach out to the child is the differentiator. We use all our power to empower and equip the child.”
Goodchild at The Children’s Media Foundation believes that social media services are covered in grey areas of legislation. He says: “Social media is creating new opportunity but also new pressure on kids [who] are obsessed by likes. Getting a like will negate their in-built preferences for trying to protect their own safety and security.”
He adds: “We are all complicit in it because we all do campaigns, as a kids content maker I know I have to work with those guys because that is where the audience is but the organisations themselves are not prepared to put their hands up and say it is fit for purpose. If you have a vast number of children using your services, you have to stand up and be accountable.”
Perhaps more brands, content creators, providers and curators will wake up to societal concerns around online safety for children, particularly when issues are raised by users themselves. A combination of educating parents and empowering children could prompt those businesses to launch more child-friendly products and services and to take account of the changing behaviour of kids online.
The ad industry is looking to tighten its rules around children in advertising by creating an automatic ban on sexual portrayal of under-18s or those who appear to be under 18.
As advocacy groups in the US call for further regulation of advertising on the YouTube Kids app, marketers in the UK can learn some lessons in creating clear advertising to avoid similar controversy according to legal expert Dan Smith.

Just Eat wants to remove any friction around online food ordering and ensure it is ahead of competitors so that it is ready should Amazon or Microsoft come calling.
Just Eat is placing a bigger focus on new technology such as virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to ensure it stays ahead of the curve, as new players enter the increasingly competitive takeaway sector.
The online food delivery brand hosted an event today (22 November) to showcase some of the technology it is developing. This includes:
●    Virtual reality: Using VR, it offers restaurant partners a bird’s eye view of its orders that can highlight patterns, hot spots and opportunities for growth.
●    HoloLens: Using augmented reality, the experience enables customers to see a restaurant menu as a buffet for them to pick and choose from.
●    Customer care chat bot: Built using the Microsoft Bot Framework, this development sees AI integrated into the ordering experience to ensure that customers receive round the clock support and service.
●    Delivery robots: In September, Just Eat began testing self-driving delivery robots on the streets of London, designed to increase delivery capacity for restaurant partners. Pilots are taking place in Greenwich, London.
Just Eat, which recently overhauled its advertising, and the look and feel of the brand, is one of a number of brands operating in the rapidly growing takeaway sector. According to Euromonitor, the sector was worth around £5.3bn in the UK last year, but that is expected to rise to £8bn by the end of the decade. That growth has attracted a number of new players, such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats, which are looking to disrupt the sector once again.
Just Eat is all too aware of the competition. And so it is on a mission to “remove friction that is preventing adoption” among restaurant partners and consumers, said chief product and technology officer Fernando Fanton.
“We want to leverage data and put it at our restaurant partners’ finger tips, so it’s super easy for them to understand what small actions they can take to grow the business,” he said during the event.
“It’s not crazy to think that in the near future we can [develop] an extension of our chat bot where consumers can speak to a virtual waiter. Not only does he know everything about Indian food, but he also knows everything about you. Everything we have on show today is just the tip of the iceberg.”
Besides trialling new tech itself, Just Eat also launched a food tech accelerator programme earlier this year to help the next generation of food technology startups. It has invested £20,000 in five companies in return for a 5% stake in each as it looks to “help pioneering young companies”, according to CEO David Buttress.
Just Eat’s global CMO Barnaby Dawe told Marketing Week the programme enables the company to “constantly disrupt itself” to ensure it is always at the forefront of the sector.
He said: We want to see where we can go with it so we remain ahead of the curve. We want to be at the top table of those conversations with the likes of Amazon and Microsoft, so when they’re developing tech they come to us.
Just Eat is also looking for new investment opportunities, with a particular focus on social food tech ventures in the not-for-profit sector.
Dawe concluded: “There are lots of really interesting not-for-profit organisations that are working in the food tech space, including those that look at food waste management for example. We are interested in that space and have amazing data around customer behaviour and food, so we can do some good with that.”
Just Eat is rebranding in a bid to expand into different “food occasions” and convince consumers that take-away is not just for dinner.
As Just Eat launches its “industry-first” group ordering service on Apple TV, the brand’s UK marketing director Ben Carter tells Marketing Week how it plans to become part of customers’ everyday lives.

From chatbots and AI to breaking the Google and Facebook duopoly, brands at Web Summit in Lisbon ambitiously embraced tech as the cornerstone of future global growth.
Messaging apps, chat bots, machine learning and artificial intelligence – these were the key topics on everyone’s lips during three days in Lisbon.
Social media giant Facebook used Web Summit as the platform to announce the rollout of ads on its news feed that open directly into Facebook Messenger chats.
The idea, explained vice-president of messaging products David Marcus, is to give brands the opportunity to go from mass targeting to one-to-one conversations in a single click.
“For the first time, advertisers can use the targeting capabilities of news feed to reach a very wide audience and then go one-to-one inside Messenger. We see ourselves as really solving a problem between mobile web and apps, with a layer of emails on steroid.
I would be surprised if I didn’t see double-digit numbers of orders delivered by robots over the next couple of years.
“You have the ability to communicate but at the same time build a native experience and, unlike with email, you never open a new thread so it is in context with all of your previous interactions.”
Brands will also be able to send sponsored messages to consumers who have already opened a thread with them and add reference parameters to a link to determine where their bot traffic is coming from. So from now on if a consumer clicks on the m.me link (which opens in Facebook Messenger), brands can track the link and send them tailored messages.
“They have the ability to track end-to-end from the click to the conversion and they can do that from any source just adding the parameter to any URL, to create better personalised experiences inside a specific thread,” Marcus added.

Facebook Messenger bot technology, voice and AI are of real interest for on-demand food delivery app Just Eat, explained CEO David Buttress.
“Over the next six, 12, 18 months, you will see us do more and more in that space. I would be surprised if I didn’t see double-digit numbers of orders delivered by robots over the next couple of years.”
Having begun trialling self-driving delivery robots in North Greenwich in July, Just Eat is keen to roll this technology out to other London boroughs in the coming months. Buttress is confident consumers are ready to have their food delivered by robot and the rise of automated delivery will not be a case of if, but when.
Although food delivery rival Deliveroo is yet to trial robot technology, CEO and co-founder William Shu encouraged businesses to start considering the AI issue before it is too late.
“This is not an Uber question or a Deliveroo question, it is a question for society in general. As the world advances and more basic tasks pass to robots, what happens to jobs?” he asked. “That’s a question that is incredibly hard to answer. There are a lot of different situations – utopian and dystopian – and it is part of our responsibility to determine what the future of work looks like.”
A lot of discussion during Web Summit centred on the digital advertising and content duopoly enjoyed by Google and Facebook. In the opinion of Facebook CMO, Gary Briggs, both platforms are benefitting from placing an early bet on mobile, ahead of the chasing pack.
“Facebook and Google made a move really early in terms of making a bet towards mobile and we are four or five years into that,” said Briggs.
“What’s really necessary is to be fast and you have to put yourself in a position to execute and understand faster, and if you’re not doing that you have to adapt. One of the things that both Facebook and Google have done is adapt very fast.”
Despite appreciating how Google and Facebook have claimed so much of the ‘ad pie’, Forbes CMO Tom Davis argued that opportunities still exist for traditional publishers.
“You can see waves throughout the history of advertising where there’s been big players dominating the ad market. It comes back to what the consumer wants and needs. Whether it’s Google or Facebook, or some of the other new media properties, a lot of companies are finding out what’s good for consumers.
“But there is room for traditional publishers that have built that gravitas and also have some level of scale. So I think there’s still room for both.”
Chairman and CEO of the Publicis Groupe, Maurice Levy, argued that disruptors will shake up the market and break Google and Facebook’s stranglehold, as long as they can move at speed.
“Every player has to move very fast and clearly the fact that Facebook and Google are very big players is pushing a lot of people to invent new forms of communications and find platforms for the future alongside these behemoths.
“The real way to exist is to be more creative and targeted. We have seen the renaissance of publishers and the same kind of solutions with TV, where there are a lot of TV channels. We have reinvented and found new approaches in order to better target the audience.
“I am confident there will be new solutions and challengers to Google and Facebook and that will be good for everyone.”
“It is so easy to criticise ad blocking and our business model, but let’s be honest, most of the ads out there are incredibly stupid,” argued Till Faida, founder and CEO of Ad BlockPlus.
Speaking on the Panda Conf stage, Faida argued that the ineffective nature of banner ads has caught advertisers in a vicious cycle where they need to make adverts more aggressive to capture attention and this does not resonate with a tech-savvy, young audience.
“They should see it as a wake up call to innovate. That is what we’re doing with our acceptable ads programme, which means they’re showing alternative, less intrusive ads,” Faida explained.
“We have been able to prove that fewer, higher quality ads actually provide more value for publishers, so we can establish a more sustainable ecosystem, not a race to the bottom.”
This view was countered by Stewart Rogers, director of marketing technology at tech news site VentureBeat, who asked how publishers large and small would be able to pay journalists, analysts and engineers without ad revenue.
“Because ad revenue is reducing we’re being forced to put content into walled gardens like Facebook and making corporations like that richer. It’s leading to publishers putting their content behind a paywall or forcing us to look at new ad models such as native advertising and advertorial, which takes us away from journalistic integrity.”
Rogers warned that the problem is being exacerbated by CMOs under pressure to provide a green number on a spreadsheet by CEOs and CFOs who do not understand the value of high quality advertising.
Publicis Groupe chairman and CEO Maurice Levy, however, acknowledged that ad blocking is a wake up call for agencies to strive to produce more creative content.
“It is our responsibility to create ads that people want to see. The solution to ad blocking is to be creative and develop other forms communication. The fact that there is ad blocking is a wake up call for us. We have to be much more creative,” Levy added.
With 250 million unique users a month, eight billion page views and over 40,000 communities, social news aggregation and discussion website Reddit understands how to achieve consumer engagement.
The key, argued website co-founder Alexis Ohanian, is realness. He argued that after years of consuming overly filtered images on Instagram, people are finally craving a sense of authenticity.
“Over the past few years, I’ve seen the dramatic growth in platforms like Snapchat because people want real shit,” stated Ohanian. “We’re tired of this age of a very filtered version of ourselves that we present to make our friends jealous of how cute our puppy is or great our vacation was. We want to be our fullest selves.”
In a world where there is an infinite supply of content, creators need to be prepared to fight hard for attention, and it is only going to get worse Ohanian warned.
“There is a 12-year-old with a smartphone who will post a video of her dog that’s going to get more views than whatever project you’re working on and it’s going to be heartbreaking, but that’s the bar we have.”
However, the good news is that the internet is open to anyone who has a story worth telling, as long as you are willing to have a real conversations, the Reddit co-founder added.
“In the days when everyone is suffocating with photos that have been photoshopped and the false versions of people’s lives, what we are starving for is realness and authenticity. But that kind of connection takes trust and security, and when people can act like themselves online real conversations happen.”
To scale for growth and capitalise on the rise of machine learning, AI and algorithms, data scientists are in serious demand.
Over the past year, Tinder has doubled is workforce to 200, with a specific focus on beefing up its data science and engineering department. The team are responsible for innovating the app’s complex matching technology, explained CEO Sean Rad, as well as developing tailored algorithms and exploring the prospects for artificial intelligence.

From dating to food, demand for data engineering skills is outstripping interest in every other discipline, a clear indication that brands are committing to investing in data and insight capabilities as they aim for global domination.
“Brands” is a new way to distinguish your above units. By classification a type of above unit as a “Brand”, you have the choice to give a custom logo, cover, or name to that above unit.
I second the thought that there are certain ads that are really stupid and adblock would help prevent people from seeing it again and again. However, adblock is also going to disturb the marketing model as well. My opinion is that a system should be designed that will assist in blocking ads that are not relevant. A system should be designed that is going to filter ads that are not relevant. Rather, it should only pass those ads that are up to the mark and that flaunts quality. There are some top agencies that create awesome ads for their clients to gain maximum exposure and engagement on digital marketing strategies.

The use of messaging apps is growing worldwide along with the sophistication of artificial intelligence and ‘chat bots’, but can brands earn the right to share this private space and how will consumers choose to respond?
Used by billions of people worldwide every day, messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat and Line have been cemented as an every day part of life. However, as consumers opt for the privacy and speed of chat apps, brands are still playing catch-up in their attempts to devise more sophisticated methods to connect with consumers.
More than 77% of content shared via mobile takes place on messaging apps, according to research by RadiumOne, but consumers need a compelling reason to interact with brands in an environment they do not consider to be public. This channel is sometimes referred to as ‘dark social’, as people share content out of general view.
An element of exclusivity can help create a messaging group consumers actively want to join. Adidas took this approach with the global launch of Tango Squads in July – communities of socially savvy 16- to 19-year-old football obsessives operating on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Line.
READ MORE: Adidas on redefining influencer marketing through dark social
Spanning 15 cities worldwide including London, Milan and Berlin, each ‘squad’ numbers between 100 and 250 people. Adidas hopes to reach a maximum of 500 members per squad by 2017.
Members receive exclusive content and get to see new products before they hit social media, as well as being invited to take part in one-off experiences, such as meeting footballers like FC Barcelona’s Lionel Messi.
“If it comes as a referral from your mate, you’re much more likely to pick it up than if it comes from a brand.”
Discussing the concept at the Festival of Marketing last month, Adidas senior director of global brand communications Florian Alt explained that the squads are not about achieving reach, but are focused on the authentic advocacy offered by these “hyper-connected kids”.
“These are the guys who will push out your stories and content. They give it longevity and authenticity, because they are talking in a private messaging environment. If it comes as a referral from your mate, you’re much more likely to pick it up than if it comes from a brand.”
Alt sees the clear advantages of inviting consumers to get closer, even if it means “giving up a little bit of autonomy and the keys to your brand”.
Adidas cannot, however, measure the effectiveness of its messaging app approach in the same way that it would on social media. The success of the strategy is therefore assessed by feedback from local teams managing the communities, which so far has been highly positive.
“It could be this is redefining influencer marketing. It could be this becomes an Adidas insider tool for face-to-face communications or it could become a bad-ass loyalty programme. Tango Squads could be a combination of all three. That’s the beauty of it.”
BBC News and BBC World Service began experimenting with chat apps in 2014 in a bid to assess the editorial potential of mobile-first platforms. So when the Ebola virus crisis hit West Africa in 2014, BBC World Service apps editor Trushar Barot was ideally positioned to react quickly, using WhatsApp to disseminate life-saving information.
“At the time, WhatsApp was the most downloaded app in West Africa, so rather than developing our own app we could use an app that was already on their phones to push out content and information about the Ebola crisis that was genuinely valuable,” explains Barot.
“We shared audio clips, images and text in English and French, rather than pushing links back to the BBC site as that would eat up their data.”
Aside from speed, messaging apps suited a region like West Africa where data is relatively expensive and audiences are connecting to the internet for the first time through chat apps.
The ability to generate audience feedback was the most valuable part of the experience, explains Barot. The WhatsApp group enabled the BBC team to find out what information people on the ground needed to know, such as whether Ebola could be contracted from a mosquito bite or a public swimming pool.
Working with a BBC health correspondent the team pushed out 45-second audio clips via WhatsApp, an important method as literacy levels were often low among the target group.
Over a nine-month period, the Ebola WhatsApp group attracted more than 25,000 direct subscribers, not taking into account the private WhatsApp groups where content was shared. The BBC was able to use country codes to work out where the 25,000 subscribers were based, ranging from 12,000 in Sierra Leone to 5,000 in Nigeria.
Worldwide consumers are becoming more comfortable interacting with brands on messaging apps. More than a billion messages are exchanged between consumers and businesses on Facebook Messenger each month, according to Facebook research, with 63% of people saying they do this more now than they did two years ago. Over half (53%) of those surveyed say that they are more likely to shop with a business they can contact via a chat app.
To make interactions slicker, in September Facebook enabled brands to roll out newsfeed ads that link people straight into a chat with a bot on Facebook Messenger.
To coincide with its brand relaunch in September, food delivery app Just Eat took a two-pronged attack introducing a Facebook Messenger chat bot and launching on Amazon’s Echo connected home device.
Although the basic function of a chat bot is to respond to customer queries, Just Eat UK marketing director Ben Carter sees the potential for discovery. Consumers could, for example, ask the bot for inspiration of what cuisine is good in their local area and the bot would respond with a list of ‘tried and tasted’ restaurants.
“Demand for WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger has completely changed how we interact and it is only natural that a brand should provide a service on this platform,” says Carter. He suggests companies that believe chat app interactions should be purely transactional are missing the point.
“Look at Echo, Siri or Google Home – they are all about asking everyday questions. It is really important not to see [chat apps] as just another sales channel; it is about education and engagement.”
Carter urges brands to put the platform into context and strike the right tone as chat is not a place where consumers naturally want to interact with brands. However, the opportunities are significant.
“Chat represents a small part of our time now, but is going to be very important going forward. You’ve got to balance the time spent versus the potential, and as a marketer be conscious of who you are as a brand and who is the target audience,” Carter adds.
Online gift website Buyagift decided to tap into the shift to messaging apps in October when it began trialling a WhatsApp group to share exclusive offers in the run up to Christmas. Consumers were invited to sign up to the group through email and social media marketing.
It is crucial to be where the consumer is, says head of customer retention Lianne Harrison, who considers WhatsApp “the future of marketing”.
“We had seen other brands doing it and I was receiving and opening messages all the time. Emails might see a 25% open rate, but with WhatsApp it is pretty much 100%. Messaging is a very direct and quick way to communicate with the consumer,” she adds.
Harrison sees the chatty nature of WhatsApp as a good way to drive engagement, as well as offer exclusive deals and competitions, though it is important to limit the number of messages so as not to be intrusive.
Moving into messaging apps is a smart move for brands since social activity is increasingly being diverted to messaging apps, argues DigitasLBI strategist Tony Wright, who says brands need to be clever in their approach.
“Messaging apps provide a more intimate form of communication and can be more personalised than having to please 100,000 people. However, brands also shouldn’t drop their influencer relations [through social networks] as they still need to attract big audiences.”
With over one billion users each it can be tempting to think that WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are the only apps worth consideration, but Barot at BBC World Service believes there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach.
Facebook Messenger, for example, is a better fit for Western markets where consumers are more likely to be on premium devices with better mobile data plans.
In comparison, WhatsApp is a simple chat app better suited to regions where data is relatively expensive or it is difficult to open web browsers. Therefore it is often better to post content directly into the chat rather than link to a website.
The choice of app might also be determined by privacy concerns. Telegram is popular in Iran where it is widely considered one of the most secure messaging apps, Barot explains.
As the BBC Persia website is blocked by the Iranian government, BBC World Service started sharing content on Telegram, attracting more than 500,000 subscribers in a year, with some pieces reaching one million people.
“Demand for WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger has completely changed how we interact.”
Since 2014, the BBC World Service has experimented with regionally popular chat apps such as Line, Viber, Telegram, Skype, WeChat, FireChat and Hike, as well as apps targeted specifically at millennials like YikYak and Kik, which are gaining popularity among millennials in the US and UK.
Recent pilots include the use of emojis on WhatsApp during the Indian elections, sharing short films on Line and using Viber for the ‘real time reconstruction’ of a Mexican kidnapping story by BBC Digital Current Affairs.
Brands are increasingly experimenting with chat bots and artificial intelligence (AI) to service customer need. To date more than 30,000 bots have been built for Facebook Messenger since the technology launched on the platform in April, while Google unveiled smart messaging app Allo in September, incorporating the AI-powered Google Assistant (see One to watch: Google Allo below).
Just Eat’s Carter is excited about the opportunities for AI to move beyond machine learning to natural language.
“When we expand into natural language, and you throw in AI and voice, everything goes to another level. Whether that is chat bots or home voice products, this technology is definitely going to become as common as a search on Google and any brand that wants a mass consumer base will need to be there.”
READ MORE: Why marketers should take notice of Amazon’s and Google’s connected home launches 
The BBC’s Barot believes the next stage in chat apps will be a combination of messaging bots and AI assistance. “Now that Microsoft, Google and Facebook are positioning themselves as AI-first organisations there are really exciting opportunities for the automation of bots with a deep level of AI to offer a much more satisfying experience.
“Over the next 18 months, I expect to see that combination of AI and natural language processing, which will be really fascinating.”
Fellow broadcaster Channel 4 was quick to recognise the opportunities of AI to promote the return of Humans, a TV series about humans interacting with artificially intelligent ‘synths’. Taking inspiration from the use of bots by retail and service brands, Channel 4 worked with Facebook’s Creative Shop on a chat that enabled fans to talk to bots via Faceboook Messenger.
The bot had to function on a technical level, but also incorporate a complex extra layer of storytelling. To reflect the show’s storyline about machines ‘waking up’, the synth bot began to malfunction during the chat. In total more than 3.8 million messages were exchanged during the campaign period.
For deputy head of marketing Laura Ward, it was crucial that the AI was advanced enough to incorporate the vital storytelling element.
“The AI had to function well enough to be both believable and entertaining. To achieve this, we worked with Facebook to ensure we had the right people involved from the start.
“Our bot developer Pullstring included Pixar’s former chief technical officer and we brought the writers of Humans into the scripting sessions to ensure the voice of the bot was authentically part of the series’ narrative.”
Ward believes brands have to earn the right to be in a consumer’s personal space alongside messages from their friends and family by creating innovative experiences.
“From an entertainment brand’s perspective it’s an opportunity to deepen engagement with your brand and extend your storytelling in a very personal way. If you get it right, it is likely to lead to much more engagement with your brand in future,” adds Ward.
Despite presenting an exciting new platform for brands to interact with consumers, messenger apps can have their downsides with regard to metrics. BuzzFeed chief marketing and creative officer Frank Cooper acknowledges the difficulties of measuring the impact of communications in this channel compared to the clarity of social media metrics.
“It is super tough. The good thing for us is a large proportion of activity happens on our own platforms, so we can extrapolate from it. But the toughest part is imagining the full impact. Comscore doesn’t get close at all, so that’s one of the biggest challenges faced by any content producer or brand to give full account of the impact,” adds Cooper.
The BBC checks referrals by adding a specific code to the end of any URL posted in chat apps, which can then be tracked in a system like Google Analytics or Comscore. The code can be made specific to the campaign or messaging site, so the team can see how many people have travelled to the site from that link.
Telecoms company O2 is tracking interactions via messaging apps by integrating sharing widgets and URL shorteners that enable the team to track how content is shared. O2 can, for example, identify core consumers who share content regularly with friends.

While the term ‘dark social’ has been coined to reflect the difficulty of measuring the impact of campaigns on messaging apps, senior lecturer in digital communication and future media at Birmingham City University Mark Brill believes brands need to stop thinking in these terms.
“It’s only dark social if you’re a brand. To me it suggests a wedge being driven between consumers and brands. The term dark social sounds adversarial and is not about engagement,” explains Brill.
“Brands need to understand what the audience are doing there and in terms of engagement think pull not push.”
Although the opportunities to connect with consumers via messaging app are vast, brands need to develop a sophisticated and nuanced approach to their messaging app strategy if they are to earn the right to share that space with friends and family.
What is it? A ‘smart’ messaging app with Google Assistant AI technology, launched in September 2016.
The AI element: The integrated Google Assistant function allows users to ask a bot a question within any chat. The user simply types @google into the chat to ask a question or can message the assistant one-to-one.
Other features: Users can insert stickers, doodles and oversized emojis as well as text and photographs. The smart reply function suggests text and emoji responses based on the user’s personality. There is also the facility to start an ‘incognito chat’ by sending messages with end-to-end encryption and users can control how long they want messages to exist.
This article caught my eye and I think it covers a lot of ground!  One thing which didn’t get a mention (and I’m not sure why it gets overlooked by many marketers) is the power of a referral programme to get your brand’s message into the ‘dark social’ channels.  I work for Mention Me and we run a referral software platform where we see sharing messages in Apps like: WhatsApp, Messenger, Line and Weibo which receive on average 3 clicks back for every link shared AND they go on to convert to a new customer between 2 and 5 times more effectively than traditional social media.
Marketers need to think about the social dynamics of dark social – it’s nature means it is more trusted and potentially more relevant than broadcast media but, I totally agree with the quote from Mark Brill – brands should see it as a ‘pull’ rather than a ‘push’ channel.
Dark social squads of hyper-connected brand advocates are fuelling Adidas’ bid to become the “hottest social currency” in football. 
O2 is looking to personalise the communications it sends out on its owned and earned media by tracking users on ‘dark social’ – content sharing that cannot be accurately tracked because it takes place on messenger apps or via email, rather on Facebook or Twitter.
Even though 75% of all online content in the UK is being shared through dark channels – areas not measured by web analytics such as links sent via email, online forums or private instant messenger platforms such as WhatsApp – brands are still “overwhelmingly” neglecting the space, according to new research from RadiumOne.

Marketers are earlier adopters of most new technology than the consumers they serve, so it’s dangerous to make media plans on the basis that your personal habits are universal.
You are not the same as your target market. In attitudes and behaviour, values and political beliefs, it’s unlikely you mirror those who buy your products and services.
The shock felt by the vast majority of those in the marketing and creative industries when the British public voted to leave the European Union underlined this.
Elsewhere, research unveiled last week by Ipsos Connect and Thinkbox shows that those who are responsible for choosing where advertising budgets are spent are more advanced in their social media use, on-demand viewing and always-on connectivity than Joe or Josephine Public.

With regard to technology adoption, brands also appear to be ahead of their audience. A report last week by Verint and IDC found 79% of people would prefer real-life human interaction over a digital or machine-based one. Artificial intelligence, augmented reality and other sexy new toys may capture the imagination of the forward-thinking marketer but do they add value for the majority of consumers?
Don’t get me wrong, being ahead of the adoption curve is an admirable thing. Not sharing the same world view or media consumption habits as your customers is not a problem as long as you do not forget this golden rule when setting marketing strategy: don’t assume your customers are as you are, or are fired up by what you are. You know nothing about your customer until you bother to find out.
That doesn’t mean marketers shouldn’t be looking at new ways to reach customers, meet their needs, anticipate changes and use the tools available to them. However, chasing the future at the expense of the present is not the answer. Make media, technology and service choices on the basis of actual behaviour and not how you think people behave.

Marketers often devote their attention at Christmas to big TV campaigns and eye-catching retail promotions, but ensuring existing customers are as engaged as possible in the winter months is just as crucial to a profitable festive period.
Christmas marketing is often associated with glitzy advertising campaigns, in-store displays and festive product offers. Although all those elements often enter the mix, Christmas is also a time for customer relationship management (CRM) specialists to play a big role by targeting customers and driving promotions through data.
Fashion and lifestyle retailer Joules uses a range of offers to attract new customers and encourage people to buy gifts in the lead up to Christmas. Last week, the brand launched its annual ‘Nearest and Dearest’ flash sale. Although the campaign does not directly promote Christmas, it serves the purpose of expanding Joules’ customer database ahead of the busy festive shopping period.
“It is almost like our introduction to Christmas,” explains CRM manager Dimple Shergill. “Our customers have come to look forward to the Nearest and Dearest event, and it’s the perfect lead-in to our Christmas campaign.”

Joules uses Oracle Marketing Cloud to run its CRM campaigns. This includes sending out different welcome emails to new customers according to the category they have bought from, such as womenswear, menswear and baby clothes. The creative within these emails changes during the Christmas period to promote Joules as a gifting destination and this is reflected in messaging presented on the brand’s website when recipients click through.
Furthermore, customers who sign up to receive Joules’ catalogue in the post are presented with the same Christmas offers online that they would see in the print product. “We look to complement offline with online activity,” says Shergill. “Segmentation is key to being successful, so we look at our customer data to help identify our various customer subsets that are email-engaged, and those that are less engaged, and tailor the communications accordingly.”
Joules is developing its CRM programmes with the aim of creating a single customer view. This includes targeting specific offers at customers by looking at how frequently they engage with promotions, as well as the other product categories they may be interested in buying from.
Joules is also looking to use its personalisation tools to phase out discount codes in favour of adding them directly to the customer basket online. Shergill notes that this helps to make the customer journey easier, as well as ensuring that the relevant promotion goes to the right customer.
“We have myriad offers out at any one time, so we try to ensure that the customer only sees the right offer for them,” she says.
Salesforce’s annual conference Dreamforce, which took place in San Francisco last month, highlighted a number of new trends in CRM, such as the growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) within CRM systems. Salesforce used the event to unveil its ‘Einstein’ product, which has predictive capabilities and looks to bring AI technology to brand campaigns.
The tool is powered by machine learning and promises to get smarter with every customer interaction, allowing it to predict future behaviour and recommend next actions. However, AI remains a work in progress and it is too early to say how brands will apply the technology. Upon launching Einstein, Salesforce stated that it would set up a research group focused on the future of AI under the leadership of its chief scientist Dr Richard Socher.
Even without the addition of AI, certain brands are approaching their CRM strategies with a view to being more predictive about future behaviour this Christmas. Men’s styling service The Chapar is targeting women – rather than its male usual target market – in anticipation that wives, girlfriends and female relatives will choose the company as a potential Christmas gifting option.
The Chapar, which selects and sends trunks of premium clothes to its customers, is planning to advertise its services to women in the lead-up to Christmas, including its option of a gift card. It plans to feed the customer data from these target female customers into its Salesforce CRM platform and send gift-related messaging in the final days of the Christmas shopping period.
“We will be launching a series of campaigns in the run up to Christmas Day,” says Sam Middleton, founder and CEO of The Chapar. “We have learnt over the years that some women are actually as bad as men in terms of being last-minute present buyers. With that in mind we see gift cards as being a great business opportunity as it brings new members in as loyal customers.”
Other brands are focused on targeting existing customers and driving reorders for Christmas. Buyagift, which specialises in gift ideas and experience days, states that it is “targeting customers dynamically” using the RFM model of segmentation, which involves looking at how recently a customer purchased, how frequently they purchased and the monetary value of that customer.
The company also looks at the product categories in which customers have frequently bought or browsed to drive its retargeting activity at Christmas. Head of customer retention Leanne Harrison says that partly as a consequence of Buyagift’s “reactivation activity” this year, its active customer database is already 39% higher than it was in the run-up to Christmas in 2015.
“We are implementing some test and insight programmes in order to understand what customers react best to to ensure we’re focusing on the right timing, targeting and messaging so that we are fully prepared for peak,” adds Harrison.
As brands seek to build a responsive, predictive CRM campaign that will drive sales this Christmas, marketers must similarly ensure they do not neglect existing customers in the search for new ones.
One-to-one communications are increasingly replacing above-the-line campaigns.
Envisioning your product or service as a subscription offering might lead you to consider how you would do your market differently.
The two companies may have settled their dispute but they are not giving much away over who conceded, or whether they reached a compromise.
Brands need to address the missing skills in marketing departments by focusing on core abilities, offering training and adapting quickly to change.

Marketers warn against jumping on the latest tech fad and instead focusing on doing something of consumer value.
The pace of tech innovation has presented brands with a fresh challenge as to the best way of reaching consumers.
As brands up their focus on technology, however, they risk losing their ‘human’ characteristics. Channel 4 is looking to overcome this challenge by ensuring that its brand values are emotive and come from its “unique” remit. It wants people to feel positively towards the brand, rather than being seen as simply providing a functional service.
“Our values haven’t fundamentally changed since we were set up. Our remit says we have to provide a place for the kind of voices that don’t always get heard, we have to challenge the status quo. They are emotional values – not functional,” James Walker, head of marketing at Channel 4, told Marketing Week.
And even though there are many more ways of reaching people, Walker believes consumer needs have not changed.
“Consumers still want the same things out of life. It’s important that you are making an emotional connection, and lots of ads are trying to do that. Video by its nature is emotional in terms of how it makes people think and feel,” he said.
With no physical outlets, online-only brand Airbnb has aimed to put “human” values at the heart of its business by telling authentic user-generated stories.
“We are fortunate we can humanise our comms through our hosts or the people travelling using our service. Our brand always involves human interactions, and our job is to tell these stories,” said Ben Kendall, UK marketing manager at Airbnb.
“Great brand marketing is when you tell amazing stories, as that’s what our consumers buy into. The more real and authentic, the more attached we are to that brand or product. And there’s always a story within a brand. Authentic is a buzzword that people overuse, but it’s all about being honest and true.”
There is also the potential danger of innovating for innovation’s sake, where brands are putting technology ahead of actual consumer needs.
“So many brands jump onto the latest fad and try to pigeonhole technology into a media form. That’s exactly what consumers don’t need,” Kendall commented.
“Using technology for technology’s sake is dangerous as it might lead to people switching off.”
“Rather than wanting to win awards and gain acknowledgement from industry peers, brands should aim to do something of value to their end user and community.”
While it can be tempting to chase the latest technological fad, brands need to avoid rushing into anything and carefully consider whether their budgets can be better spent elsewhere.
“When I get pitched an idea, I firstly think of what else might I spend it on. While you should always reserve a bit of the budget to do something innovative, you have to have effective and robust thinking behind it,” Walker commented.
However, Walker added that technology is “getting to point where brands can innovate at scale”. For the latest series of Humans, Channel 4 created a bot in conjunction with Facebook. People could talk to the bot thinking it was purely powered by artificial intelligence, but halfway through the conversation it suddenly develops a consciousness.
“That fitted brilliantly with the show, and it wasn’t seen just by fans as we could push it out at scale. Even though it was a brilliant stunt, we still had to be careful to make sure we were investing in the right thing.”

Making the transition from disruptor to viable long-term business is not easy but in order to stand the test of time brands must continually evolve and take risks while staying true to the values that made them a success in the first place.
Consumers do not always say what they mean, which is giving rise to new forms of market research based on emotional reactions.
Businesses frequently use the term, but what does it actually entail and who should be responsible for its execution?
Marketers often devote their attention at Christmas to big TV campaigns and eye-catching retail promotions, but ensuring existing customers are as engaged as possible in the winter months is just as crucial to a profitable festive period.

On a recent visit to a friend’s house, I was proudly introduced to his new ‘virtual assistant’ called Alexa.
Alexa is the personification of the artificial intelligence behind Amazon’s smart speaker Echo. Alexa has a growing number of daily tasks she can help you with, for example telling you about the traffic on the way to work, or more importantly for Amazon, helping create a shopping list online.
On this occasion, I was interested to understand what kind of personality Alexa had, so I posed the question “Alexa, do you like Apple?” She responded without hesitation “companies that begin with ‘A’ are awesome”. I was taken aback at the witty, unexpected response and began to wonder if Alexa was someone at the other end of a phone or I had significantly underestimated her artificial intelligence.
The launch of Google Home this autumn sees the battle for the smart-home personal assistant market hotting up. It also clearly demonstrates the desire of these once digital brands to gain a dominant physical presence right at the centre of our homes.
With these digital super brands getting physical with us, how should more traditional, physical brands and manufacturers design their connected products?
We all want to create a stronger relationship with our consumers. An excellent foundation for this relationship is an ecosystem that offers value based on a continuous two-way dialogue of data. As both Amazon and Google have established, a connected physical device can play a key role in this ecosystem. However, its centrality, prominence and physical permanence also makes it one of the more difficult parts of the system to implement. Code can easily be updated, physical components are less flexible.
In the vast majority of cases, a connected device will take the place of a non-connected device in an existing system. As such, it is important to understand how the connected device could add value and change things for the better. To do this we start by establishing the purpose and the performance of the system that the device inhabits. This then forms a baseline benchmark to assess the proposed changes against.
The metrics used to assess the performance of the system will change depending on the application; however, they will normally include descriptions such as effectiveness, efficiency, safety, inclusiveness, satisfaction, and flexibility. If the introduction of a connected device is not expected to impact these performance metrics, the value of the product can be quickly called into question. It’s also important to track them all in parallel to ensure the optimisation of some doesn’t negatively affect others.
At DCA, we have developed a ‘layer cake’ to clarify the options for how to connect products and devices (see below). We have found it a powerful tool in establishing and validating the specification of a new connected device proposition before diving into the development work.
Each layer can be considered as analogous to a step in the process of verbal communication. The choices made in each layer will be driven primarily by the device’s functionality and the environment in which it will operate. These decisions will determine the device’s complexity and hence its size, cost, power consumption and development timescale.
The top layer is the Application layer. Here, the high-level decision on what you want to say must be made – what information should the device transmit, maybe orientation or temperature? In some cases, it will be acceptable and desirable to use existing apps to send, receive and process the data. In others, bespoke applications will be favoured.
In the next layer, Interoperability, the decision to make is which language to speak – such as English, French, WeMo or SmartThings – or which ecosystem to buy into. There are many languages to choose from, each with their own characteristics and strengths, including those created and supported by technology giants such as Apple (HomeKit), Samsung (SmartThings) and Google (Weave). There is also an opportunity to develop bespoke languages, as Honeywell has done with its EvoHome system.
Moving further down our ‘layer cake’ in the Data Transfer layer, a protocol must be decided upon (akin to deciding what words to use and which sounds to make). Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are the most widely known, but other alternatives, such as Z-wave or ZigBee, offer an interesting alternative if bandwidth requirements are low as the cost of such systems may be much lower (though additional infrastructure, such as a hub, may be required).
Finally, at the base of our diagram (the Physical layer), the way of making sounds – for instance with a mouth or a loudspeaker – is analogous to the decision between wired and radio communication. For simplicity, the diagram (left) focuses on radio communication, as this typically offers the greatest convenience for installation, but there may be cases where a wired connection is preferred (for example because of concerns over stability, security or interference).
Lastly and definitely not least, for consumers to engage with your connected product the multisensory experience must be right. As Alexa answered my mischievous question, she ‘turned’ and looked at me via the intensity and direction of a blue ring of light. Her tone and response was warm and playful. I was creating a relationship which I enjoyed.
If you’re designing a lawnmower that helps you understand your garden or a hairbrush that tells you about your scalp, make sure you have the right multidiscipline team of researchers, designers, and engineers (mechanical, hardware and software) who understand both physical products and digital systems. Then you can craft and deliver a relevant experience that criss-crosses seamlessly between the physical and the digital worlds.
Physical product brands and manufacturers have never before had the opportunity of building such a close and continuous relationship with their customers. New ecosystems of services can be built through an open and continuous dialogue of data. If you haven’t already, it is probably time to take the opportunity.

With Amazon and Google both launching connected home devices, brands need to start exploring the opportunities.
Whenever technology giants like Amazon and Google enter a market, other brands tend to sit up and pay attention. In recent weeks both companies have taken big steps into the connected home, with Amazon launching its Echo home hub device in the UK and Google unveiling its Home controller during a press event this month. Besides pitting each brand against the other in the fight for supremacy over the ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT), these launches could mark a significant tipping point for consumer adoption of connected technology.
Amazon Echo has been available in the US for two years, where it has sold around three million units, so its launch in the UK confirms Amazon’s confidence in the product and its desire to gain a foothold in connected households globally.
Echo is ostensibly a voice-activated speaker that connects to music services like Spotify and Amazon Music, but it can also take commands and speak back to the user like existing smartphone technology such as Apple’s Siri. This could include reading out news headlines, calendar appointments or ordering services from other websites. Echo can also activate smart home appliances like Philips Hue lighting and the British Gas smart thermostat system Hive.
Google Home, which is due for release on 4 November, is also a voice-activated speaker that offers the same services, including compatibility with existing Google smart products like Chromecast and the Nest thermostat. Google’s advertising for the product states that with the user’s permission, “Google Home will learn about you and get personal”. This could include providing traffic information or setting alarms and timers based on people’s online information and behaviours.
In other words, Amazon and Google are trying to put themselves at the centre of the connected world with products that become more and more intelligent through machine learning. Research company Gartner predicts there will be 6.4 billion ‘things’ connected to the internet by the end of this year, up 30% on 2015, and that the figure could soar to 20 billion by 2020.
“The connected home is still a niche concept for consumers, but any time a company like Google takes a step into a market it’s significant.”
Despite this surge in connectivity, consumer adoption is still relatively low. A Mintel report earlier this year found that just 14% of UK adults have a smart kitchen appliance and only 7% own a smart thermostat, though 35% have a smart TV.
Mintel’s head of technology research Matt King believes the launch of Google Home could prove to be an important moment for the industry. “The connected home is still a niche concept for consumers, but any time a company like Google takes a step into a market it’s significant,” he says.
First and foremost, both Amazon Echo and Google Home have accessible price points that may tempt consumers who have previously balked at the cost of connected technology. The Amazon Echo is on sale for £149.99, while Google Home will reportedly retail for around £100. Both products boast significant improvements in voice technology that should encourage more consumers to start talking to their devices.
Furthermore, the willingness of both companies to connect their devices to smart products and services offered by other brands reveals their desire to create an open, accessible ecosystem that will draw in consumers. “We’ll see more companies working together because it’s still early days for this technology,” says King. “Making it simple for consumers is going to be key.”
Brands from outside the world of technology are already expressing excitement at the possibilities of connected home technology. Speaking at the Festival of Marketing earlier this month, Unilever CMO Keith Weed referenced both Amazon Echo and Google Home and suggested that voice-activated artificial intelligence is an emerging trend that marketers should pay close attention to. Indeed in Amazon’s own marketing, it talks about the ability for people to order from Just Eat or Uber by talking to the Echo.
“We have quite an unnatural relationship with devices now where we prod [them] with our fingers and [they] respond,” said Weed. “It feels much more natural to talk to each other and I think in three years the power of voice will be there.”

In anticipation of this trend, certain FMCG brands are testing smart packaging that could fit into the wider IoT ecosystem. In August, drinks brand Malibu launched a UK pilot in which it made 40,000 of its bottles compatible with near-field communication (NFC) technology of the kind used for contactless payment.
The bottles, sold in Tesco stores, allow people to access exclusive content such as prize draws, drinks recipes and playlists when they hold their smartphones up to the packaging. The pilot was developed with IoT agency SharpEnd, which sets up testing centres for smart technology at the head offices of several major brands.

The agency also ran a research project with Mindshare earlier this year in which it trialled 10 connected packaging prototypes in five UK households. This included using NFC and Wi-Fi-connected smart buttons that allow people to re-order their favourite products by pushing the device. As part of the trial, the Amazon Echo voice assistant was also set up to speak to people with recipe information and re-ordering options related to the smart packaging.
SharpEnd founder Cameron Worth believes that the launches of Amazon Echo and Google Home signal the rise of “zero user interface”, where people will reduce their interactions with screens in favour of speaking directly to faceless machines. This will compel brands to redefine how they communicate with consumers, he argues.
“If you think about a brand that has spent millions of pounds on digital marketing – banner adverts, apps and things like that – suddenly they are having to wrestle with a device that has no screen and no brand messaging opportunities,” he says. “It’s just about having short, sharp interactions with a robot.”
Worth suggests the technology will move brands away from standard forms of messaging and advertising, prompting them to shift their focus to “brand behaviour”. This could involve thinking about how brands can work with connected home technology in a seamless, reactive and non-intrusive fashion. “That’s an entirely new consideration for brands,” he says.
It’s an intriguing prediction for marketers to ponder as both Amazon Echo and Google Home hit the UK market – and as more and more products become connected.
At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month, futurists and tech enthusiasts were debating the bleeding edge of consumer technology, with the internet of things (IoT) taking centre stage.
Amazon has launched its Dash Button service in the UK, allowing consumers to order and restock products with the single push of a button.
Malibu is using connected technology in a bid to rid the world of bar queues and bring club and festival goers’ drinks directly to them.
During this year’s Festival of Marketing, Marketing Week and Econsultancy hosted a debate sponsored by Microsoft on turning data into actionable insight and the challenges it presents.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

From artificial intelligence going mainstream to brands being urged to take their philanthropic efforts more seriously, Marketing Week takes a look at some of the key talking points from Dreamforce 2016.

Roughly 170,000 people descended on San Francisco this week to attend Dreamforce, an annual conference hosted by cloud computing company Salesforce. We round up the themes that dominated the on-site conversations.
The biggest theme of the week was artificial intelligence (AI), not least because Salesforce unveiled its new ‘Einstein’ product during the event, which has predictive capabilities and looks to bring AI technology to brand campaigns.
But the technology also dominated conversations held away from the keynote sessions. Bob Stutz, chief analytics officer of ‘data visualisation engine’ Wave Analytics, certainly seems convinced of its uses.
“AI is certainly ready to go mainstream. I have a long history with it myself – back when AI first came out in the 1980s, the engines were very expensive and building algorithms with accuracy was hard,” he said.
“Back in those days, AI moved in decades. Every new advancement took years, while today, advancements are made every few weeks. It gives you better insights that you can’t get from a static CRM system.
“As a marketer, AI means you won’t spam the living hell out of your customers.”
Melinda Gates, co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, also believes new technology like AI can make a real difference to the world – but only if minority groups are included in its development.
“When you think about where we’re going with technology, and artificial intelligence and data, it’s astronomical. What it’s going to do for medicine in terms of early diagnosis, it’s exciting. But if you don’t have underrepresented minorities at the table, we’ll be making the same mistakes that now seem somewhat small, but they could be enormous down the line,” she said.
As a result, a more diverse community needs to have a seat at the table, so that AI can be designed using the right set of questions and that the data entered into the system is unbiased.
She explained: “You don’t want to have a photo app that comes out that doesn’t recognise different skin colours or different types of eyes. We need to make sure that diversity is rich in the system and that all the data we’re using and tracking works for everybody. I see AI as something that will democratise society, but it has to be done the right way. It’s about inclusion.”
Diversity and philanthropy played a big part during this week’s events. One of the keynote speakers included (RED) CEO Deborah Dugan. (RED) was founded in 2006 by U2 frontman Bono and Bobby Shriver to engage businesses and consumers to help fight AIDS in Africa.
During the keynote talk, Dugan explained that her diverse background, which includes marketing, helps her in her role as CEO and that attendees should put more of a focus on instilling personal values into their jobs.
“I have been a M&A lawyer for four years, have run a record label and worked at Disney. I’ve learnt how to make deals, do marketing and branding, how to work with talent and how to engage consumers,” she said.
“You shouldn’t leave your values at the door in the morning. For me, my values and business skills converged at (RED). What we try to do is the ultimate ROI, which is life save.”
Musician and tech entrepreneur Will.i.am urged attendees to invest in education, as he believes many of the industry’s jobs could be filled by disadvantaged inner city children if their education was improved.
However, he also criticised Dreamforce’s current demographic, saying: “The room would have looked the same in 1916. And it could be so different – you’d be having completely different competitors.”
Salesforce also showcased its research into the current state of B2B marketing. Its annual survey questioned nearly 4,000 marketers across the globe for their thoughts on overall trends and the changing role of marketing.
The report predominantly draws on ‘high performers’, which are marketers who are extremely satisfied with their current business outcomes realised as a direct result of their company’s marketing investment.
The survey shows that 82% of high-performing marketers have their executive’s team “complete commitment” to their marketing strategy. But according to Salesforce, many B2B marketers still struggle to gain executive approval.
“Executive buy-in needs to happen before anything else. Good executives will allow for agility and flexibility, which is important to us as marketers.”
“With B2B content marketing, most audiences are probably not on the edge of their seat to receive the latest report, so don’t rush it out the door. Marketers need that executive support so they can take their time,” says Heike Young, content innovation lead at Salesforce.
Corinne Sklar, chief marketing officer at digital services agency Bluewolf, says many B2B marketers also struggle to align the sales and marketing teams when it comes to customer relationship management (CRM).
“Marketers weren’t usually involved in the implementation of CRM. Now marketers need to sit down with sales and design one file, which includes marketing automation at the front and CRM, and design an integrated strategy.

From Sir Martin Sorrell on Facebook video ads, to Fitbit’s move further into healthcare and MasterCard’s attempts at mastering the selfie, find out everything you need to know from the past week in marketing.
Fitbit launched an IPO in June this year
Sir Martin Sorrell, the boss of WPP, believes more needs to be done to improve ad measurement and validation on social media sites.
Speaking at the Festival of Marketing on Wednesday (5 Oct), he admitted that five years ago analysts saw Facebook and Google as “enemies” of WPP, but now he sees them more as frenemies.
This year, Google was WPP’s biggest media investment and he said by 2018 he expects Google and Facebook to be its biggest two. Despite this, Sorrell doesn’t expect Facebook to overtake Google anytime soon.
“Search is more powerful than social. It is no accident that Google outperforms Facebook four to one,” Sorrell said.
He believes one of the issues is that Facebook is still being both player and referee and that the industry needs to improve measurement.
“Facebook can’t really claim that a three-second view when 50% of the time the sound is off is the same as a 15-second, a 30-second, a 60-second TV ad or someone reading The Times for 40 minutes,” he said. “And we have to address this by having better measurement.”
While its fitness trackers have proven popular among health conscious consumers, Fitbit is going one step further and will be focusing more heavily on healthcare, as it looks to produce products that aid consumers with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Earlier this week, the brand’s CEO James Park said that that brand’s mission has always been to “help people become healthier”.
Fitbit devices use motion-sensor technology to track user movement, which it combines with user data to calculate distance walked, calories burned, stairs climbed, quality of sleep and even the intensity of a workout.
“At this point we have shipped close to 50 million devices around the world. That’s 50 million lives and people across the world that we can affect in a pretty meaningful way, which means positively impacting their health,” he explained.
“The mission of the company has been to use data from sensors, use inspiration from friends, family and social tools, and artificial intelligence in the future, to help people become healthier. We want people to become more active, exercise more, sleep better and eat better.”
This week, Unilever’s Keith Weed, urged “a lost generation” of marketing leaders to tool up for digital or risk getting left behind, as he said that a generation of marketers leading businesses are bluffing about their knowledge of the digital landscape.
Weed believes that a generation of marketers are slipping through the net and need to act fast to ‘tool up’ for the disruptive digital world or risk being left behind.

“We have three versions of people. On one side we have the digital natives who have been born and bred in a digital world. On the other side we have people like myself in my 50s who have children in their 20s and if I didn’t engage with them on digital platforms I wouldn’t have a relationship with my children,” Unilever’s chief marketing and communications officer commented.
He continued: “In the middle we have what I call the ‘lost generation’, people in their late 30s and early 40s who don’t yet have grown up children who are digital natives and weren’t digital natives themselves.
“These are the very people who are leading so many of our brands and businesses, and they’re bluffing too much about digital from what they read in the Financial Times or Marketing Week.”
Weed urged marketers to ensure they are fit to lead by embracing training and shaking off the association that taking part in training is “admitting I’m not as good as I probably should be”.
Earlier this week, Facebook took on rival Ebay as it introduced its Marketplace service, which allows users to buy and sell items from their local communities.
The move imitates Ebay and Gumtree’s own marketplace sites and could very well leave them both looking over their shoulders.
The marketplace has been launched on the Facebook app in the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand and will allow users to both buy and ell items to friends or within their local communities. It will also allow businesses to take part. Integration on desktop and more markets is expected over “the coming months”.
Unlike Ebay, which relies on buyers and sellers exchanging emails, the Facebook ‘Marketplace’ will be fully integrated into Facebook Messenger, encouraging people to debate prices or meet up via the app.
Mastercard is jumping on the ‘selfie’ bandwagon with the launch of ‘Selfie Pay’, new technology that uses biometrics to verify identification.
The move aims to aid customers who are concerned about fraud and want a quicker way to make online transactions. It moves away from the less-secure nature of passwords.
The update allows cardholders to verify their identity by using biometrics such as fingerprints or facial recognition – the latter, requires users to take a ‘selfie’.

‘Selfie Pay’ has been introduced in 12 countries including the UK, Germany, Belgium and Sweden, with the motivation of the campaign coming down to “passwords being a pain” and a demand for updated identification technology.
“All of us have frustrating experiences with the sheer volume of passwords we need to remember, in varying degrees of complexity.  We want to create a safe and easy consumer experience by allowing consumers to authenticate their payments with who they are (biometrics) not what they may or may not remember (passwords),” a spokesperson from Mastercard told Marketing Week.
Festival of Marketing 2016: Unilever’s marketing boss is urging “a lost generation” of marketing leaders to tool up for digital or risk getting left behind. 
Sir Martin Sorrell expects further admissions that brands have over-invested in some areas of digital after Procter & Gamble said it went too far in targeting consumers on Facebook.
As the social network integrates WhatsApp users’ data into its own systems, Facebook’s global deputy chief privacy officer claims all data businesses are being subjected to “unfair suspicion” due to a negative atmosphere in the media.

Fitbit is focusing more heavily on healthcare, as it looks to produce products that aid consumers with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Fitbit is putting a bigger focus on healthcare by producing products for consumers suffering from chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease.
Speaking during a keynote session at Salesforce’s Dreamforce event in San Francisco yesterday (5 October), CEO James Park said the brand’s mission has always been to “help people become healthier”.
Fitbit devices use motion-sensor technology to track user movement, which it combines with user data to calculate distance walked, calories burned, stairs climbed, quality of sleep and even the intensity of a workout.
“At this point we have shipped close to 50 million devices around the world. That’s 50 million lives and people across the world that we can affect in a pretty meaningful way, which means positively impacting their health,” he explained.
“The mission of the company has been to use data from sensors, use inspiration from friends, family and social tools, and artificial intelligence in the future, to help people become healthier. We want people to become more active, exercise more, sleep better and eat better.”
The brand is teaming up with Salesforce to make artificial intelligence a bigger part of its data analytics. It will use Salesforce’s ‘Einstein’ application, which has predictive capabilities, to create targeted ‘one-on-one’ customer experiences.
Park also said the brand is looking to become “even more integrated into the healthcare ecosystem”. Some if its most recent products have focused on reducing stress, and in future the company hopes to develop devices that can tackle chronic health conditions.

“We want to help customers with hypertension, pre-diabetes, diabetes and cardiovascular conditions,” said Park. “We are involved in over 200 clinical trials, including studies that look at how exercise could possibly reduce the occurrence of breast cancer.
“This [brand] orientation can have a dramatic impact on the whole health ecosystem.”
Fitbit currently dominates the activity tracker market and is, ahead of companies such as Apple that are also moving into the space. It still has challenges to overcome, however.
Research by Mintel shows that 60% of UK consumers are concerned about the security implications, and more than half say they do not see the value in wearable devices.
To combat these concerns, the brand decided to take a more emotive approach to marketing. It become an official sponsor of the BBC’s Sports Relief this year for the first time and aimed to raise £500,000 for the charity event by donating a percentage of sales from its Charge HR (£7), Flex (£5) and Blaze (£20) trackers.

In order to increase its appeal in the UK market, Fitbit is also upping its fashion credentials. Its Alta fitness band, including variants by fashion designer Tory Burch, was launched at the beginning of February and is more fashion-led in design with a customisable, colourful appearance. The Blaze fitness smartwatch, meanwhile, has an interchangeable leather strap.
Despite its share price dropping by half in the past month, wearables brand Fitbit is forging ahead with a new marketing focus, sponsorship of BBC Sports Relief and fashion-focused products.
Smartwatch manufacturers are failing to convey the benefits of their products in their marketing and communications, according to a senior executive at Fitbit, the world’s largest wearables brand.
Apple is hoping wireless technology, better battery life and partnerships with the likes of Nike and Nintendo will be enough to get iPhone sales growing again. But have consumers moved on?

The launch of two Pixel smartphones, a VR handset and its ‘intelligent agent’ Google Assistant are all about a future with artificial intelligence at its core.
There was fighting talk yesterday (4 Oct) as Google launched its new Pixel smartphone. After its designs led to a comparison with Apple’s iPhone, Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, responded “but [the Pixel] has a less clumpy camera”.
The new phones, Pixel and Pixel XL, which move away from the company’s original Nexus range, will be taking on other smartphone manufacturers, including tech giant Apple.
Despite this, Google did not seem deterred, saying that the new devices not only offer “less clumpy” cameras but they feature the “highest rated smartphone cameras ever”, with features including better low-light sensitivity and unlimited photo storage.
Other updates in Google’s ‘family of hardware’ include the company’s new ‘intelligent agent’ platform ‘Google Assistant’, which is built into the new phone. Google has also introduced a ‘Daydream View’ headset and controller which lets users “explore new worlds in virtual reality with just their phone”.
The company also introduced Google Home,which is similar to its competitors ‘Amazon Echo’ and its new Chromecast Ultra.
Speaking at the event, Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai said the move is part of a shift to an AI-first world.
“The last 10 years have been about building a world that is mobile-first, turning our phones into remote controls for our lives. But in the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available,” he explained.
Thomas Husson, principal analyst at research firm Forrester, believes the launches show “Google moving up by trying to compete more directly with Apple”. Although he thinks Google could have more success with the Pixel phones than it did selling direct to consumers with its Nexus range, he stresses that “this is not a hardware game” and its intelligent agent update with ‘Google Assistant’ is something Google will push across all its products and services.
“Google is after reach and will remain a platform embedding its intelligent agent into as many products and services as possible including the new DayDream VR headset,” he said.
Husson believes that in order to stay relevant to marketers in the long run, Google will have to leverage artificial intelligence to power conversations across the products and services consumers use.
“Search is becoming more personalised, contextualised and happens via new interfaces, with more visual and voice-based requests. Google will want to remain an intermediary between brands and consumers. For marketers, it will mean they will have to own as many mobile moments as possible but also to master data to borrow moments on these new platforms,” Husson adds.
Having announced several new changes, including the introduction of cross-device targeting, to its advertising network, Brad Bender, Google’s VP of video and display advertising, says creating poor online video advertising is now “very costly”.
Google has finally released its long-awaited chat app Allo, but will AI capabilities be enough to challenge established rivals such as WhatsApp?
Although full of praise for the impact of campaigns such as This Girl Can, Google UK’s head of ads marketing Nishma Robb believes female-focused marketing must now evolve or risk being seen as formulaic.
BP has dramatically shortened the amount of time it takes to test and launch new products as it looks to ensure it cannot get disrupted by newer digital players such as Amazon.

Google has finally released its long-awaited chat app Allo, but will AI capabilities be enough to challenge established rivals such as WhatsApp?
Google has launched its chat app Allo, which differentiates from other messenger apps by using artificial intelligence (AI) to assist within user conversations.
The AI tool, referred to as Google Assistant, leverages all of Google’s power in storing and finding out information. This means two friends having a chat about a restaurant can, for example, instantly find out where the closest burger joint is without the need to close their chat window.
This capability has faced early criticism after it emerged Allo’s integration with Google’s AI tech requires messages to be sent without end-to-end encryption.
Back in May, Google pledged that rather than keeping messages forever, Allo would stored them “transiently” – ensuring that full chat logs were quickly deleted and also stored anonymously. Yet today’s launch clearly shows it has backtracked on these features.
Experts appear to be split on whether Allo will be a success. Tom Ollerton, innovation director at We Are Social, says the AI features shows Google is “ahead of the game”.
He explains: “The real innovation is AI services being embedded into the chat. Allo knows what you are talking about and integrates Google services into your chat, such as recommendations and directions.
“We’ve seen similar AI integration with different bots in Slack and Skype, but Google has really got ahead of the game with this while Facebook remains fixated on winning the chatbot commerce battle.
“In the future it will be commonplace for automated assistants to be present in our conversations, and Allo is the first example for consumers to try out.”
However Tony Wright, a strategist at DigitasLBi, isn’t convinced features such as AI and predictive messaging will be enough to steal users from WhatsApp, which boasts more than one billion monthly active users.
“There are countless apps on most people’s phones already. It’s hard to see why someone would want to add another never-ending stream of notifications and messages to their life,” he explains. “It’s definitely in part a reaction to what the likes of Facebook are doing with messaging apps. But Google’s famous for failing numerous times to crack social, which they proved with Google Plus, so I can’t see users rushing to Allo.”
Wright believes Allo will offer value for marketers but says the success of the new app will rest completely on how well it will integrates with other Google products.
He concludes: “I imagine at some point brands will have the opportunity to pay for coverage in the AI’s responses to people’s questions about travel arrangements, hotel bookings etc.
“Google loves to integrate its products into one another, so there’ll be some sort of search, PPC equivalent within its app products at some point perhaps.”
Will Allo be a success? Let us know in the comments section below. 
Messenger now has 700 million users while WhatsApp has 300 million but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says while the plan is to monetise those services any meaningful revenue is still some way off.
Brands could be able to connect with consumers via WhatsApp, according to Facebook’s CFO David Wehner.
Google used its annual I/O developer conference to lay out how it will move beyond the smartphone into artificial intelligence, messaging and virtual reality but what it didn’t do was explain the position brands will hold in this new future, raising concerns they could end up “making a deal with the devil”.

Tencent is China’s biggest brand and it now has its sights set firmly on fuelling growth outside its home market through a focus on content, messaging and major global brand investment
Tencent is China’s biggest brand. It has more than 1 billion monthly users, runs the country’s most popular internet portal and messaging services, and last year generated revenues of almost £12bn.
It is also the most valuable brand in the country, worth £85bn according to Millward Brown’s BrandZ. That valuation also puts it ahead of the likes of Coca-Cola, Disney and MasterCard.
But in the UK, and most of the rest of the West, the brand is relatively unknown. Despite this, when Marketing Week catches up with Steven Chang, Tencent’s corporate vice-president, it is clear from the start how much investment and importance he places on the parent brand.
“Tencent is the mother brand. In China, trust is one of the most important [aspects of a brand] so the company itself represents a lot of value and meaning. According to BrandZ we are one of the top brands in the world, that represents the trust level, not just how available it is,” he explains.
“For China, it is the same as the rest of the world. There may be different sub-brands or product brands but the mother brand is always the key one. It has to be.”
“You can have the iPhone but you buy into the Apple brand. And [in China] people buy into the Tencent brand.”
Chang believes key to Tencent’s success is a clear brand identity. Its vision is to be ‘the most respected internet company’ while its mission is ‘to enhance people’s quality of life through internet services’ – messages that are prominent both internally and externally.
Yet from the outside Tencent’s brand can seem confusing. It owns messaging app WeChat, internet portal QQ, the SOSO search engine, social network QZone, Tencent Weibo – China’s answer to Twitter – and online payment service TenPay. It also owns a chunk of ecommerce service JD.com and Uber rival Didi, as well as stakes in Riot Games and Epic Games and has invested in movies such as World of Warcraft.
That broad range can seem odd to Western eyes but Chang says there is a common thread that runs across all these services: content and connections.
“We want to connect. People to people, people to devices, devices to devices. We provide platforms like WeChat so people can connect. Then on top of those connecting platforms we need to provide content,” he explains.
“[There is also] the opportunity to offer convenience to the consumer so we develop payment services. It is not just the commercial value, we look at this in a bigger way in terms of helping to provide convenience. To make their lives easier, whatever we can see we can do that. We are building an ecosystem.”
Tencent’s approach definitely seems to be working. QQ has more than 860 million monthly users and Chang claims it is the “biggest ID system in China”. WeChat has 760 million, while QZone has more than 570 million.
But despite these numbers, Tencent is far from content. In particular, it wants to be known outside China and is making a big push in this area, particularly with WeChat and its gaming platform.
“It is important [to be known outside China]. China we are very focused on for obvious reasons. However there are two particular areas. We are the biggest game developer in in the world so in terms of games we are pretty global. Games are one area and games as IP we can develop into movies and animations, we are working with that,” he explains.
“Then there is another global expansion through WeChat usage. It currently has more than 20 languages, 180 countries use it. It is still primarily Chinese but we are getting more and more Westerners using it.”
While Tencent may not be that well known among Western consumers, it is a different story with Western brands. And the likes of BMW, Burberry and Nike are all working with Tencent as they look to quickly transition their brands to a Chinese audience.
Yet Chang says it is not as simple as taking what has made a brand successful in the West and applying it to China. He uses the example of movies to highlight his point. Last year, the new Star Wars film was the biggest grossing film globally. But in China three of the top five were locally produced films and the biggest Hollywood movie was Fast and Furious 7.
“The local culture, interests and tastes are very important. You cannot simply bring in Hollywood and likewise you can’t just bring in Western products and everything you have been doing successfully and expect it to work. You have to understand the local nuances, local consumer needs, what they are interested in,” he says. “There is a China way.”
He points to some big differences. Mobile, he says, accounts for 90% of internet usage in China and that has a big impact on commerce, how consumers view content and news consumption. For example, QR codes are an important marketing tool and their usage is only increasing where in the Western world they are on the decline. Therefore, a retail strategy that works in the UK is likely to be irrelevant in China.
Big issues in digital advertising in the West such as ad fraud and viewability are also of lower concern in China. Instead the focus is on standards. In China there is no equivalent to the IAB so the big brands are working on setting standards, with Tencent recently doing a deal with Nielsen to develop a “digital ad rating” for China.
“The ecosystem for China digital advertising is evolving but it will be a China edition. We are not behind; the speed of change is very fast but development is different,” he explains.
One area where Tencent is doubling down is content. During our interview at Cannes Lions, Chang was keen to bring the conversation back to content and Tencent’s strategy here. It is buying in content through exclusive deals with creators such as HBO and the NBA. But Tencent is also adopting what Chang calls the “Netflix model” and creating its own content.
That, he says, offers Tencent a better way to monetise because it can get brands involved from the get-go and use its data to understand what viewers enjoy and adapt content accordingly.
“If we produce it we own the IP and we can do a lot more. For example, we can do branded entertainment, product placement and using our data and understanding of the audience we can co-create with marketers. The opportunity is much bigger,” he says.
Tencent also needs to find new ways to grow its revenues as China’s economy slows. It slipped to 6.7% in the first quarter of 2016. Although this is still well ahead of the rest of the world, it is China’s lowest growth for seven years.
Chang, however, remains bullish. Although Chang predicts that growth in ad spend, like the rest of the economy, will slow this year, he backs digital ad spend will come in at just less than 30%. And he claims Tencent is growing even faster, with revenues up 43% in the first three months of the year.
Chang says Tencent is already testing new technology such as virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence, as well as working to ensure it offers the best user experience to give both consumers and advertisers a reason to come back.
He concludes: “We have the content, the data and can make best use of social inference to link all this together. This is quite unique.”
This year’s BrandZ Top 100 sees Chinese brands move down in the rankings, owing also to the banking and oil and gas industries facing pressure. Chinese brands’ average value dropped by 9% versus 2015.
Tourism body VisitBritain is set to launch its largest marketing effort in China as it looks to not only boost tourism from the world’s fastest growing economy, but also to encourage visitors that start and finish their holidays in London to explore other parts of Britain.

Film has played a central role throughout Sara Frain’s career, setting her up to lead marketing at art house chain Picturehouse Cinemas. She explains the key influences on her career development.
Sara Frain’s career path demonstrates the benefits of specialising in a single industry. Since beginning her career as a temp at a small cinema chain called Oasis Cinemas, she has become one of the most influential marketers in the UK’s film scene.
Subsequent roles as director of sales and promotions at film distributor Tartan Films, and then general manager at Metrodome Group, saw Frain manage marketing campaigns for a wide range of independent film hits such as Super Size Me and The Counterfeiters. In 2010, she became group marketing director of art house cinema chain Picturehouse Cinemas. The company, which specialises in high-end venues and services, was acquired by Cineworld in 2012 and now has 24 cinemas across the UK.
Frain, an inductee to the Marketing Week Vision 100 in partnership with Adobe in 2016, explains how her background in film marketing has helped her to adapt to different projects and to focus on putting the audience first.
There are a lot of small moments that have become defining moments. Starting in a small exhibition company allowed me to learn all about independent film exhibition, from programming to new cinema openings and most importantly audiences. It was about putting the audience at the heart of every campaign. This led me into film distribution at Tartan Films, running campaigns on titles such as Secretary and Belleville Rendez-Vous and the launch of the Tartan Asia Extreme brand.
I have transitioned successfully from independent exhibition to distribution and back again to Picturehouse, where I have brought my experience into the business with the successful launches of four new cinemas and by breaking out art house titles such as The Imposter and The Lobster to a wider audience.
Marketing films is transient and fast moving – with every campaign there is an element where you start again, so developing an understanding of audience and how to reach them through the various communication channels available is essential. It’s really challenging to market independent films and cinemas without the big budgets that the studios have, so there is a need to be more creative and innovative within your strategy to ensure great films get out to as wide an audience as possible.
Picturehouse has had a very exciting and progressive last few years – a benefit of being part of a much larger cinema organisation. Deeper pockets have allowed us to expand more rapidly with new cinemas, including our flagship in the West End, Picturehouse Central.
This has also brought its challenges. Keeping the independent identity of each of our venues becomes more important the bigger we get. Decentralising key aspects of marketing communication, such as installing local marketing managers at every site has been a key part of ensuring that each Picturehouse cinema continues to sit at the heart of its local community.
The biggest single game changer has of course been digital, and in particular social media. It is an extremely efficient and cost effective way to reach an audience. Digital has also allowed us to segment our audience; targeted bespoke emailing has really changed the landscape of marketing film and other content. I remember when I first started out in the business, I was told by an experienced marketer that if the film is successful, it’s a great film, but if it doesn’t work, it’s a bad campaign. The difference these days is that we can really see what works and what doesn’t work as digital marketing allows us to see the value of every pound spent.
Be passionate, be true to yourself, have fun, enjoy learning and be willing to roll your sleeves up and get stuck in with any opportunity that comes your way.
Marketing success increasingly depends on a brand’s ability to read emerging trends in technology and consumer behaviour before making strategic adjustments at speed. This helps to explain the rise of the chief futurist: a somewhat grand, space-age title for a person that helps brands to predict and shape the future.
It is no surprise that tech companies have led the way in employing futurists. In 2012, Google appointed American author and renowned futurist Ray Kurzweil to work on new technology projects on a full-time basis, including those involving artificial intelligence.
In a blog post announcing his appointment, Kurzweil wrote: “In 1999, I said that in about a decade we would see technologies such as self-driving cars and mobile phones that could answer your questions, and people criticised these predictions as unrealistic. Fast-forward a decade – Google has demonstrated self-driving cars, and people are indeed asking questions on their Android phones.”
Other big brands that have employed futurists include Volvo and Cisco, while in 2014 virtual reality startup Magic Leap hired science fiction writer Neal Stephenson to work as its chief futurist.

More than 600,000 startups were registered in the UK last year but those that have the best chance of securing funding for future growth are the ones that put marketing high on the agenda.

Following Sainsburyâ€™s acquisition of Argos, Ebay says it is open to putting pop-up or click and collect experiences within the supermarketâ€™s 1,200-store estate.
The supermarket giant’s £1.3bn acquisition of Argos-owner the Home Retail Group will create 1,000 new jobs and is expected to result in many Argos stores being transformed as concessions within Sainsbury’s larger stores.
Ebay already has a partnership with Argos (pictured) that allows its 200,000 UK sellers to drop off sold products across the brand’s estate – which Argos then delivers – or for buyers to collect items. The online auction brand also launched pop-up stores in London back in 2012.
Speaking to Marketing Week, Ebay’s director of EU advertising strategy, product and operations Phuong Nguyen said the Sainsbury’s deal could create even more opportunities.
“The prospects are huge and the merger makes a lot of sense for both groups,” said Nguyen. “It could potentially mean that [eBay pop up stores or a click and collect set-up within Sainsbury’s stores], yes.”
A move to include Ebay would make sense for Sainsbury’s, with it previously revealing it has around 6% of excess space, or about 1.5 million sq ft. 
Nguyen added: “If there’s one clear thing from the strategy with Argos we’ve learned it is that consumers today want to shop on their terms. We have to be wherever they are, and wherever they want to shop. If that means eBay being more present in locations around the UK then that’s where we will be.
“The retailers that will win can offer world class ecommerce and world class physical retail. You can be the best on digital but sometimes a consumer just wants to touch and feel a product – that’s the power of pop-up locations.”
For the post-Brexit period of June 30 to July 5, GfK’s core consumer confidence index fell 8 points to -9. The GfK survey, which dates back to 1974, has not seen a bigger drop since December 1994.
However, Nguyen is confident the Ebay proposition can continue to generate consumer spend and says it is a brand geared up well for times of austerity.
“Our proposition is geared towards people being entrepreneurial and people being cautious about their finances,” he added. “It’s about the best selection and the best prices. In a difficult economy the Ebay proposition shines the most.”
Earlier this year, Ebay partnered with Australian retailer Myer to launch what it called “the world’s first virtual reality department store”.
An accompanying iOS and Android app worked with virtual reality (VR) headsets such as Samsung’s Gear VR as the brand offered 20,000 free “shopticals” — an equivalent of the Google Cardboard headsets — to shoppers.
And Nguyen said Ebay is “exploring” VR retail experiences in the UK market as well. His advice to marketers is to back VR and augmented reality early on.
He concluded: “We’re still in our infancy but the Australian idea is a taster of where things are going. If I could start a marketing agency or consultancy anywhere right now it would be in augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Those are the areas that are going to change the face of retail over the coming years!”

Consumers’ desire to escape from hyper-digital lifestyles gives brands an opportunity to connect with them in a more meaningful way.
Consumers are bombarded by a relentless stream of communication caused by the proliferation of digital devices. But this ‘always-on’ obsession is taking its toll and leading some to search for ways to avoid the fast-paced stresses of modern life.
Whether it is through ‘digital detox’ or by tapping into an alternative reality, consumers are craving escapism and brands could be best placed to tap into this new found need for a diversion, if they do so in a meaningful way. For example, London’s first naked restaurant The Bunyadi opened last month. Phones are banned, staff and customers are unclothed, there is no electricity – tables are lit by candlelight – and food is cooked over a fire. The idea is to liberate people from the outside world.
Meanwhile, drinks brand Innocent looked to answer consumers’ need for a digital detox when it conceived the idea for its Unplugged festival, which is now in its second year.
It offers people a “weekend off the grid to escape their busy, stressful city lives where they are constantly connected to friends, email and overloaded with information”, according to brand activation manager Jamie Sterry.
He says: “Technology is a great thing but it’s important to switch off once in a while. We were concerned that after year one [of the festival] the digital detox trend would have moved onto something else, but instead it has grown and we see more statistics and information about how people are craving time off the grid.”
Sterry believes millennials are particularly influenced by the trend, which he expects will rise in London, and in festivals and entertainment more generally as people look to something “more wholesome and productive”. The fact young people are drinking less is also opening the doors for more festivals focused on well-being and holistic health, a concept he calls the “restival”.
A report by JWT Intelligence, which looks to investigate “next-generation utopias and unquantified landscapes in a world of hyper-digital realism”, suggests that the rise of ‘big data’ means there are no secrets, which is fuelling this need for escapism.
It claims Hollywood has lost its mystique now that every consumer with a GoPro camera can make a film and that artificial intelligence is replacing human brainpower. Therefore, people are increasingly turning to ‘unreality’ and a way to search for other kinds of “freedom, truth and meaning”.
“There’s a certain playfulness to it,” says Lucie Greene, worldwide director at JWT Intelligence. “It is clear there is a rising appreciation for the remaining intangible, unexplainable aspects of our lives and simultaneously an excitement and fetish for all things magic.”
In line with this theme, London’s Somerset House is marking the 500th anniversary of Thomas More’s publication ‘Utopia’ with ‘Utopia 2016: A Year of Imagination and Possibility’ – a year-long programme spanning the realms of art, society, fashion, design, architecture, theatre and film.
Department store Selfridges, meanwhile, delved into astrology and space last Christmas as an alternative take on the festive season. It opened Astrolounge, an in-store grotto for adults that offered psychic readings and mystic workshops.
Being ‘always on’ has also affected how people consume news. Stories are broken on Twitter and articles are becoming shorter as more people strive to be in the know immediately.
Delayed Gratification magazine, however, is dedicated to ‘slow journalism’. It revisits the news “after the dust has settled to give the final analysis on the stories that mattered” because “today’s ultra-fast news cycle rates being first above being right”, according to the publication’s website.
Marcus Webb, director at The Slow Journalism Company and global content director at Time Out, found that when he was looking to launch the magazine with founder Rob Orchard in 2007 there was a period of change happening in the news landscape.
“Twitter had taken off and [people were] live blogging events, there was a space and a need for something slower and effective to make the most of print,” he claims. “Magazines were trying to be websites with shorter stories and headlines were trying to grab your attention.”
Webb saw a gap for a publication that “went the other way” and says that it has “found its place”, with subscriptions doubling in the past year alone. This is because “people want a break, to strip out the white noise and [to have] the final word”, according to Webb. He believes content of this kind has the ability to surprise people.
He adds that with online media people get served content they are actively looking for but with print, one page might be on David Bowie and the next on Venezuela’s hidden Zika crisis, which can be unexpected. The latest issue includes an infographic on how many trees were felled for celebrity stories, such as ‘Justin Bieber is not in a relationship’ and ‘Fearne Cotton wears a bikini’. To monetise the business, since the magazine has no advertising, it offers a service teaching people how to create infographics.
Consumers’ need for a change of pace may be more likely to encourage people to switch off rather than turn to fantasy and entertainment, the JWT report suggests. Innocent’s Sterry points out the digital detox trend is only getting stronger and will continue to do so as more people look for a means of escaping their busy lives.
Greene at JWT says: “Audiences aren’t delusional – some of this is pure playfulness. New brands are embracing this language with a sense of fun and a wink. Elsewhere we are seeing genuine reverence, expanding from the well-being movement to the benefits and value of new-age practices.”
Brands looking to tap into this trend to get away from it all can gain from exploring themes of ‘unreality’,  detachment and escapism when communicating with consumers.
Airbnb is rapidly expanding its service away from just offering accommodation to provide a full travel service as it looks to lure holidaymakers away from “mass produced tourism”. The brand’s CMO Jonathan Mildenhall talks to Marketing Week about being a polarising brand, maintaining its “millennial cool” and its plans for the future.
Making the transition from disruptor to viable long-term business is not easy but in order to stand the test of time brands must continually evolve and take risks while staying true to the values that made them a success in the first place.
What makes brands stick in the memory and what can less ‘sticky’ brands do to change consumers’ minds?
Morrisons says it is planning to complain about an additional Aldi ad to the ASA after the discounter today (June 28) saw two TV ads and a press ad banned by the advertising watchdog. Aldi, following a complaint from Morrisons, was told by the ASA it had ‘misleadingly’ compared a weekly shop of its own brand products with branded products at the big four supermarkets.

Brands need to tackle ad fraud and and take on difficult issues, says Unilever chief marketing and communications officer Keith Weed.
Brands. Love them or hate them, they are an integral part of our lives. I challenge anyone to go into a supermarket and get out in less than 10 minutes with what they need without brands to help guide them through. At the same time, we all know that the world is changing faster than ever. It is a naive brand manager – or CMO – who isn’t considering what the brands we build might look like in the artificial intelligence-enabled, virtual reality-enhanced, social media super-charged future.
The possibilities of providing individuals with carefully tailored communications, while using a wide range of influencers – from social media savvies to academic experts – to share your brand message are re-imagining the effect that our brands can have, both on the global stage but also in very localised, culturally specific instances.
For example, brands such as Ben & Jerry’s tackling climate change with its global ‘Save our Swirled’ campaign. It brought together almost 800,000 people to march for climate justice, and more than 3.5 million signed the petition asking world leaders to shift to 100% clean energy. More locally, Persil is working in the UK with Sir Ken Robinson and Project Dirt on ‘Outdoor Classroom Day’, to get kids engaging in real play outside of the classroom. As an industry, we have the power to challenge how things are done, locally and globally. With our billions of pounds of ad budget we can really change things. And challenge and change we should.

This is not only in the area of purpose and social impact. One of the characteristics of being a CMO with an engineering background is that I am equally fascinated with both the creativity and the data of marketing. And in today’s rapidly changing digital ecosystem, that has turned out to be no bad thing.
The past few years have seen the explosion of digital advertising, and as with any multi-billion dollar industry that emerges, there will be challenges. A key topic facing us as an industry at the moment is ad fraud: activity where impressions, clicks, actions or data events are falsely reported to criminally earn revenue, or for the purposes of deception or malice. Basic reporting will show a visitor to be authentic, but it is actually fraudulent, and these fraudulent visitors can be entirely mechanical, human or a mix of both. In fact, bot traffic represents 60% of all website traffic (with approximately half of them being bad bots).
The potential damage of this activity to our profession, our industry and our brands is mission critical – the cost of ad fraud is estimated to be around $7.2bn (£5.8bn), which is around 5% of the total global digital media marketplace. By 2025, it is estimated that this figure could be more like $50bn (£35bn) – and that’s a conservative estimate. In a recent study on fraudulent activity, Unilever came out on top in terms of low fraud performance. One of the reasons for this is that we actively manage for this and have a healthy paranoia, being at the forefront of shaping how we plan and buy our media. We also work closely with the industry to lead for change, working for example with the ANA and WFA.
I have talked before about the need for trust and transparency as the magic ingredients in brand building. As an industry, we have a responsibility to create advertising that both provides utility and enjoyment for our consumers, while challenging the status quo of what we see around us – as the examples provided show. And our agencies have a responsibility to make sure that advertising gets to real people. It is as simple and as complex as that.
These issues may feel miles apart, but a week before the industry decamps to Cannes for the annual celebration of the best and most creative work of the past year, I see common ground. First, in working to tackle fraud and establish the integrity of the ecosystem. The second issue is much more wide-facing, and is about brands taking on the difficult issues, the ones where they can really have a positive effect on the world we live in. Both are within our power to change. And both are critical to the future of the brands we build.

Having a social purpose is helping brands such as Ben & Jerry’s, owned by Unilever, build a relationship with customers beyond sales transactions.
I challenge even a hard-hearted veteran of Cannes not to be inspired by the incredible work our industry produces. Seeing it always reminds me of how lucky I am to work in such a dynamic field.
Brands are continuing to waste billions of pounds on digital ads that consumers never see despite repeated warnings over the prevalence of ad fraud. It is time for marketers to step up and ensure they understand the issue and have procedures in place to deal with it or be more realistic about the efficacy of digital advertising.

Former Thomas Cook CEO Harriet Green is now at IBM, pushing its internet of things agenda and drawing on her background in marketing to lead the business through its next stage of growth
It is 7.30am, early for an interview, yet Harriet Green, vice-president and general manager of IBM’s internet of things, commerce and education business, is full of the energy she displayed on stage at the brand’s Amplify conference in Florida. From gushing over Gwyneth Paltrow’s health and wellbeing business Goop to asking the room’s opinion on her dress after an ironing malfunction ruined her alternative, she is full of enthusiasm.
However, it is clear that when it comes to business, Green is nothing but serious. She mentions an internal competition she took part in recently at IBM that involved different parts of the company coming up with new business ideas. “I’m so serious and still very new so I went to the head of finance and asked how much I had to spend. He said: ‘Harriet, it’s not real money, it’s just an exercise’,” she laughs.
Green comes to IBM with some pedigree in the business world. She joined technology business Arrow Electronics in 1994 and went on to hold a range of roles, including as head of worldwide marketing, before moving to electronic components distributor Premier Farnell as CEO.
In July 2012 she moved companies and industry, taking on the CEO job at Thomas Cook. The travel company was at the time in dire straits and heading towards bankruptcy. She brought it back from the brink, driving its market capitalisation to £2bn and earning herself the Veuve Clicquot Business Woman Award in 2014 as a result.
She surprised many by taking up her current role given that she moved from being in charge of a company where the buck stopped with her to leading a division. But IBM is a bigger global beast than Thomas Cook – with a market capitalisation of $145bn.
Green gives away an inkling of the decision behind the move, saying that at Thomas Cook she was tasked with turning around a business, while at IBM she is charge of forging a new one. And she believes having experience across different company cycles is paramount.
“Whether it is a startup or a mature business, whether it is a business going through an amazing transformation or a difficult one, being able to lead a business through those times and make money is hugely important,” she explains.
Throughout her career Green says she has made decisions based on her marketing experience. She works primarily with business-to-business (B2B) audiences at IBM, but other roles, including at Thomas Cook, have seen her work with consumers directly.
“The business-to-consumer (B2C) market has a very different approach to advertising and how you should engage directly with the consumer and with the business,” she comments. Green believes that a variety of experience is required across different sectors to produce a worthy CEO.
“At the core I am a marketer. I have run marketing in technology and logistics businesses,” says Green who believes that marketers have the capability of moving into general management due to their “creativity, flair and sense of vision.”
“Being a marketer is about having the ability to not get carried away with yourself and things that don’t offer great returns – these also make great qualities in a general manager.”
Green says that working with all members of a company and having an interest in them is vital to success.
“You have to really like people. It is very hard to run a business and to not like people or to care about their development and progression”, she explains. “You could have the best strategy in the world but if someone doesn’t know their part in it on Monday morning then it’s not going to work.”
At IBM, Green has done this by encouraging every person in the company to come up with an “amazing cognitive solution”. The aim of this was to find ideas that made IBM “more efficient, clients more differentiated and happy or for a solution that does something good in the world.”
The 10 best ideas have been introduced to the company, including an initiative to help people being bullied because of their sexuality.
IBM believes artificial intelligence is the future of marketing, with Green saying it will allow marketers to channel their personalisation skills.
“Everything in marketing is more and more about real time personalisation,” she says. Green adds that brands should be focusing on cloud and making use of data. “I don’t think there is a company out there that cannot participate in the cognitive era.”
Whether a B2B or B2C brand, Green believes marketers have to understand who the decision maker is when targeting customers. This involves looking at people’s roles and deciding who the influencer, the client and the consumer are. She believes that emotions should be central to decision making and it should be about learning how to target this.
“Something I always ask is: How do they think? How do they feel? How do they do? And are we driving them towards these emotions?” she explains.
Green urges marketers to look at the “staggering” amount of data now on offer to ensure they are catering to customer’s personal needs. The impact of the data should be analysed and marketers should ask themselves: “Does it enhance our brand and our positioning? And for us, does it help people understand their part in the cognitive era? Digitisation is not an end point, it is a journey and the next phase is cognitive,” she says.
Most importantly, and what she believes is at the core of business success, is for marketers to understand their customer. “Wherever in marketing you play a part, if you do not know exactly who your client is, you will not be as successful.”

Microsoft is buying LinkedIn for $26.2bn in a deal that the two companies say will “change the way the world works” but will also provide both with more data so they can serve more relevant content and advertising.
Under the deal, LinkedIn says it will retain its “distinct brand, culture and independence. LinkedIn CEO will remain CEO, reporting into Microsoft’s boss Satya Nadella. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
The deal was not totally unexpected, with both companies focused on the B2B marketing, Microsoft through software including Office and Outlook, and LinkedIn through its professional social network. Yet both have seen sales slow, with the two hoping this provides the antidote.
Speaking on an analyst call this afternoon (13 June) Satya Nadella said there would be some “easy wins” for the two companies, including the ability to allow LinkedIn users to share their Microsoft calendar with their news feed or to make it easier to access LinkedIn by incorporating it in their inboxes, browsers and Microsoft’s voice search service Cortana.
“What you will see going on in the beginning is some good quick wins. Then there will be deeper integration that offers more value but puts customers in control,” he said.
It is LinkedIn’s data that Microsoft is most interested in. Nadella believes the acquisition offers it a chance to get ahead in machine learning and artificial intelligence. He says combining LinkedIn’s profile information with what Microsoft knows about workers’ projects, calendar and companies could help “solve a relevance problem”.
“This can drive targeting and relevance to the next level,” he adds.
For Weiner, this is also an opportunity to boost ad sales and offer brands more marketing solutions. “We are in a position now where we can unlock additional inventory from within the Microsoft ecosystem. Sponsored content is our fastest growing business at scale, there is also additional opportunity there.”
Using the data that both firms have on their clients, they hope they can change the way people work. Weiner explains: “We are passionate about learning that is our core conviction and vision. The days of a professional having a job for the rest of their life have come to an end. That is a virtue of the pace of change. We want to train people for the jobs that are and will.
“This brings together the world’s professional cloud and the world’s professional network,” he says.
Marketing Week has teamed up with Teads to bring together a panel including marketers from Spotify, LinkedIn and the Lad Bible to talk Generation Z and how brands can use technology to boost their creative.
As LinkedIn hits 20 million members, data from the network reveals the most overused buzzwords and commonly claimed skills on marketers’ profiles.
LinkedIn is to provide ad services for business-to-business (B2B) brands in and out of its own platform for the first time.
Stella Artois is launching its “360-degree” Wimbledon campaign today (14 June) in a bid to bring the Wimbledon experience to the masses, using theatre to make a more emotional connection with consumers.

Google has surpassed Apple to be crowned the most valuable brand in Millward Brown’s BrandZ Top 100 ranking for 2016, valued at $229bn following 32% growth year-on-year.
Apple is now the second most valuable brand at $228bn despite an 8% drop in brand value compared to 2015. The fall is in stark contrast to last year when the iPhone maker’s value grew a staggering 67%, adding nearly $100bn to its worth.
There is now a value difference of just 0.3% between the two companies, the closest margin since the study began.
It’s no surprise that Google and Apple continue to fight it out for the top spot given technology is the most valuable category in the ranking, with a combined worth of $1,106bn, nearly three times more than when the ranking began in 2006.
Scroll down to see brands ranked 11 to 100.
Google has made a number of strategic moves to add clarity to its business and strengthen its reputation as a technological innovator over the past 12 months, which have contributed to its growth.
Last August the business unveiled Alphabet, its newly formed parent company, reinforcing its evolution from search engine to technology behemoth. The move allowed Google to separate its operations, including the search business, YouTube and Android, from other areas of the organisation such as ad tech for marketers, flying drones and developing driverless cars.
Emphasising this transition, Google used its annual I/O developer conference last month to lay out how it will move beyond the smartphone into artificial intelligence, messaging and virtual reality.
Apple, meanwhile had a break from big product launches last year, which is perhaps reflected in its second quarter results for 2016. Overall revenue was down 12.8% to $50.6bn compared to the $58bn it made in the same quarter last year.
The company also experienced its first ever drop in year-on-year iPhone sales with 51.2 million sold in during the second quarter of 2016 compared to 61.2 million during the same quarter in 2015. There are rumours that Apple will launch the iPhone 7 this year, two years after it unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6s, which will likely give the brand a boost.
While there are some big winners it’s important to note that the past 12 months have been challenging for many of the brands listed, as the global economy slows.
The combined brand  value of the BrandZ  top 100 grew 3% this year, compared to 14% in 2015. Combined value now stands at $3.4trn, up from $3.3trn last year.
It’s a different story when looking at the top 10 brands alone, however, which have an annual growth rate of 10%. The value of brands ranked 51 to 60, meanwhile, has fallen 6% and the collective worth of brands in positions 91 to 100 has dropped 3%. Looking from 2006 to now, the top 100 global brands have achieved an annual growth rate of 133%, but the top 10 have grown by 207%.

Brands in the top 10 tend to grow much faster than brands lower down the ranking as Walshe claims that “big is beautiful” for consumers, as larger brands are more prominent in consumers’ minds and are “hard to dislodge”.
He says: “These powerful brands are staking their place because of what they stand for, and as long as that is meaningfully different they have a huge commercial advantage.”
But strong brands are not immune from innovation and Walshe advises smaller brands not to “give up just because somebody dominates a category” and to “have a go and be different”.
He cites IBM as an example. It slips six places this year to 10th place after experiencing an 8% decrease in value compared to 2015. Walshe puts this down to the competitiveness of the software market and the transition to cloud, something that Microsoft has arguably been more successful at.
He says: “You have major competitors like Oracle and SAP squeezing IBM. There is a theme of [big established] brands being attacked, for example Visa, which has done well but it’s under severe attack from brands like PayPal.”
IBM comes second in BrandZ’s ranking of B2B brands, a new list for 2016.
Millward Brown’s BrandZ valuation process takes the financial value created by a brand in US dollars and multiplies it by the proportion of that value generated by the brand contribution alone.
That brand contribution is derived from consumer research that quantifies how much of the volume people purchase and how much of the price premium people pay can be attributed to brand equity, connecting what people think to what they do.
The study is based on interviews with 170,000 consumers each year, amounting to over 3 million since the ranking was first published in 2006. It looks at 14 categories across different markets and builds a brand equity score from the brand’s ability to be meaningful, different and salient.
Facebook and Amazon, which both enter the global top 10 for the first time, are two of the fastest risers in this year’s BrandZ ranking of the most valuable brands in the world. Both have moved up seven spots to claim 5th and 7th places, respectively.
This year’s BrandZ Top 100 sees Chinese brands move down in the rankings, owing also to the banking and oil and gas industries facing pressure. Chinese brands’ average value dropped by 9% versus 2015.
The highest ranked brands in the BrandZ top 100 list have grown at more than twice the rate of those in the bottom two thirds over the past decade, proving that being meaningful, different and salient drives growth.
Consumers are losing faith in information that brands publish online and on social media as they become increasingly savvy about the myriad of tactics used by marketer to reach them.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

With the UEFA Champions League final taking place this weekend, we caught up with Ann Cairns, MasterCard’s president of international markets, to discuss the power of sponsorship, innovation and the importance of marketing within the company.
MasterCard’s sponsorship of the UEFA Champions League originally started in 1994. As part of this year’s Champions League sponsorship, the brand launched a new creative platform called ‘Some call it madness. We call it priceless’, which began rolling out three months ago. Last summer, the brand also revealed it was extending the sponsorship for the next three seasons through to 2018.
On the eve of the Champions League final, we spoke to Ann Cairns, MasterCard’s president of international markets, to find out more about the brand’s sponsorship strategy and the importance of marketing.
As a big consumer marketing company, the Championship fits incredibly well from our point of view. [The matches] happen throughout the year, every year. And when you think of the product and services that we offer the general public, we want them to be used for everyday things as well as unite people with their passions, which is why it works well for us. That’s the consumer view.
On the B2B side, the event provides us with an opportunity to meet with some of our board members, as well as some of our big European customers such as the big banks and retailers. This is a chance for us to meet them, to talk about our innovations, technology and really showcase what we can do in terms of giving consumers priceless experiences. It is all of those things combined which is why it works from a B2B point of view.
It’s really all to do with how well you connect with the consumer. We’ve been doing a lot of work on social media, where we’ve been linking our event to priceless surprises, cities and linking people with their priceless passions. What we’re trying to do is bring together consumers having experiences rather than just buying things, because we feel experiences matter a lot in life. That’s how we can connect, and make people remember that MasterCard connected them to the Champions League.
No, I don’t. We are trying to be relevant to as many people as possible. When you look at a sport like football, hundreds of millions of people connect with that, I do think that this is an ideal sponsorship for us to have. It’s a priceless passion, no matter what age or country you are from, what god you worship, football is a pervasive passion for millions of consumers.
First of all, competitors make you strong. The world has never been a monopolistic place. Sometimes our competitors are also our customers. The world is a very interconnected place. The things we do to keep top of mind in our cardholders’ minds, or to keep our card top of wallet, are exactly events like the Champions League. It has fabulous cachet, millions of people connect to it and watch it. Being associated with it in a positive way, where the public is enjoying the experience, and remember it and connecting it to MasterCard as a priceless event is how we drive usage of our products and services.
Financial services are truly an important part of the economy, whichever way you look at it. People still keep their money with banks, because they trust them to keep it safe. That’s at the heart of it. In terms of the consumer experience, banks have some way to go to keep pace with the level of change that’s happening in the [banking] environment. If they can give consumers experiences they love and link to them to their passions, they can establish that report and bring them back to front of centre of people’s minds. I think that’s what banks need to do these days. Technology, innovation and marketing are as important to banks as they are to MasterCard.
I was always very interested in innovation. I was originally a research scientist when I started work, so this idea of constantly learning, seeing how the market is changing, delivering the best experience to consumers – that has been with me from a very early age. Also, I love to change a lot during my career. I think Charles Darwin said the people who survive are not necessarily the strongest or the most intelligent but the most adaptable. I think that’s very true post the internet in the business world. This view has stood me in good stead.
Very closely, because marketing is a huge area of MasterCard and marketing touches what we deliver to some of the big banks, we design how they’re going to deliver their programmes, roll out their cards, connect with digital players, what is the look and feel and how it works. All of these things infringe on marketing, so it’s a huge area for us.
We already use artificial intelligence (AI) in some parts of our business. We bought a big data analytics company called APT in the US although it works in 26 countries in the world. They have patented algorithms that use AI that really test and learn which products will sell best to the consumer and looks at reconfiguring bank branches.
The Co-op Bank has been dogged by scandal in recent years but with the launch of its new ‘It’s Good To Be Different’ campaign and renewed focus on its identity, marketing director Alastair Pegg believes the brand will now stand apart from competitors for the right reasons.
Festival of Marketing 2015: Anthony Thomson, who is set to disrupt the banking sector when he launches mobile-only Atom Bank later this year, says he “fundamentally disagrees” with the fact that most businesses’ main purpose is to make money.
John Lewis has dubbed 2015 the year of the ‘master shopper’ – a phrase it has coined for a new type of consumer that sees shopping as a leisure pursuit and knows how to use stores, the internet and mobile devices to get the best deal at their own convenience.
Two years into its four-year deal to sponsor the UEFA Champions League, Japanese car marque Nissan is looking to weave Premier League winners Leicester into its ‘disruptive’ marketing strategy for 2017.

Following publication of the inaugural 100 Disruptive Brands list 12 months ago, two things struck me. First, the positive reaction of many of our readers from so-called traditional sectors, who found inspiration in the stories of the trailblazers in their respective fields; and second, how many upstart brands it emerged we could have included when we discussed the list with those that made it on – and with many others.
It is for these reasons we bring you 100 Disruptive Brands 2017. What you are about to read is a list curated by the Marketing Week and Econsultancy editorial teams. The final reckoning was made with the input of 2016’s disruptors too – who better to recognise the essential elements of a disruptor than those widely regarded as one and the same?
Those that make the final cut represent every corner of the business world. We looked for companies that are innovative in their use of technology, that are imaginative in adapting to societal shifts and that employ structures and models which break convention.
As a result, there is panoply of talent and enterprise represented. From those using cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence for commerce or health to social enterprises tapping into the demand for purpose-led businesses. From the nimble unknowns tearing up the financial services industry to the app-based brands looking to leave an Uber-sized impression.
The ultimate intention? To identify the young brands that could be disrupting your world and to provide insight and inspiration.
Russell Parsons, Editor, Marketing Week

Marketers are increasingly keen to track the connection between consumers’ online searches and bricks-and-mortar buys, but social media also plays a growing role alongside search engines in people’s purchasing decisions.
Linking up what people are searching for and browsing online with what happens offline or in-store is one of the big challenges for marketers, who are trying to make the most of all that the digital and mobile world offers.
Figures from professional services firm BDO released earlier this month show plummeting bricks-and-mortar sales, with a 6.1% fall for April compared to the same time last year, the sharpest drop for seven years. But there was also a marked rise in online shopping, with BDO’s High Street Sales Tracker showing a 16.4% uplift in sales for the same period.
Bricks-and-mortar stores are also under pressure from ‘showrooming’ – searching online for similar products while in a shop to compare prices or find alternatives – with as many as 46% of Americans claiming to have done this, according to BI Intelligence. Blend this with ‘webrooming’, where people research online and then buy in-store, and the challenge to retailers is to make sure they have a presence wherever people are, across all touch points.
When it comes to search marketing, brands are working hard at linking what people are looking for online with what then happens in the ‘real’ world – and then measuring it. They appear to be spending ever-increasing marketing budgets on paid search (pay-per-click, or PPC), with Google’s advertising revenue up 16.2% to $18.02bn (£12.5bn) and paid clicks up 29% in the first quarter of 2016.
BMW, for example, has looked at paid search and its correlation to the number of people visiting its dealerships.
Nine out of 10 consumers research online when looking for a new car and BMW found that while 78% started with search, only 26% filled out an online form requesting more information. It wanted to see how effective a paid search campaign using Google would be, so it used its store visits metric.
Google Maps allows brands to marry up search data with location information, combined with survey information from a panel of one million people. BMW looked at this and could see that 3.5% of paid clicks on a Google AdWords paid search campaign resulted in visits to dealerships within 30 days across its 146 locations in the UK. This accounts for a return on investment of 173 to 1, according to the car manufacturer and Google.
However, tracking what people search for online to what happens offline is a continuing challenge for brands. Celia Pronto, digital integration director at Casual Dining Group, says that social media is important in marketing its restaurant brands, which include Café Rouge, Las Iguanas and Belgo.
This, combined with a strong search presence, “means that people can find its outlets when they need them”, she says – often at the point of demand. “As an industry, we are very reliant on natural search and despite some experimentation with PPC this isn’t an ongoing part of the marketing mix.
“There is definitely huge opportunity to evolve in this area. Measurement remains a key issue, as with any other multichannel business, and tracking which activity resulted in [someone dining at a restaurant] in the absence of an offer is something we are working towards addressing.”
Meanwhile, Hyundai wanted to prove to internal teams that paid search campaigns were driving footfall, test drives and sales. Google’s annual auto shopper study suggests that most test drives were made with no appointment (63%), and 22% of people who had one made it via manufacturers’ online booking forms, making customers’ research and buying journeys harder to track.
The car brand ran AdWords campaigns involving two sets of keywords for six weeks and found that 3.4% of paid clicks resulted in a visit to a dealership within 30 days. For mobile searches, the rate was 4.9% of paid clicks.
Jay Karsandas, digital marketing manager at online-only retailer Mobiles.co.uk, says  search is an integral part of the retailer’s strategy, with paid and organic search accounting for about 40% of web traffic and 30% of orders.
Karsandas says he has seen changes in people’s search behaviour over the past year, in that they will search for a deal, go to Mobiles.co.uk, then leave to look at a comparison or cashback site, so it is more important than ever for the brand to be present in all touch points. “For every search order we do, we do three orders in other channels and this is probably something we wouldn’t have looked at a few years ago,” he says.
“[In 2026] you might start your research not through search, but hop straight to Facebook”
Content is king in search engine optimisation (SEO), Karsandas adds. Mobiles.co.uk, which is part of the Dixons Carphone group, has shifted its content strategy toward a lifestyle focus, thinking about what people want to read rather than giving pieces a focus on technical aspects.
“We realised that the normal consumer doesn’t really care whether a phone has a processor 10 times better than another [or the] acronyms for it,” says Karsandas. “So we approached our SEO by looking at our customers before looking at the technical side and [thinking about] how we create SEO content that’s going to be relevant to the general consumer, and not just to the industry we sell [in]. That was a change in our strategy that’s been quite fruitful.”
Mobiles.co.uk moved away from doing several blogs a week as it found readership was low, and included more content in the main part of the website instead.
It also uses research pieces to draw people to the site through search and social media, such as the 4G Premier League, looking at which football grounds have the best mobile coverage. Luckily, Leicester City FC came out top, and then went on to win the real Premier League this month.
If necessary, Mobiles.co.uk will use paid social to give content a boost to start with, Karsandas says, and the brand finds that it will take off by people finding it organically afterwards. For a bigger campaign, the brand will use a social news site such as Hellou.co.uk to help spread content to its 4.7 million Facebook followers.
What is the future for search marketing? It is no longer the ‘dark art’ it once was, where repetitive keywords could help a brand’s website appear higher up Google’s results pages; companies are now ranked on the quality of their content, including what they link to and from, and whether they ‘make the web a better place’.
Mobile search is ever-increasing for Mobiles.co.uk, and traffic to the site via smartphones accounts for 45% of all visitors. The site can tell which handset people are using and tailor content accordingly – perhaps showing a landing page with relevant upgrades.
Indeed, a new report suggests that 2.05 billion smartphones will be sold in 2020, up from 1.44 billion in 2015. ‘The future of ecommerce: the road to 2026’, commissioned by Criteo from research company Ovum, states: “By 2026, mobile will be the dominant (but not exclusive) channel for most brands, while in emerging markets, advertising will be a mobile-first experience.”
The report adds that global mobile ad revenues will increase from $22.6bn (£15.7bn) in 2014 to $63.9bn by 2019.
So with the pre-eminence of mobile, in 10 years’ time will consumers still start with a Google search when looking for products? Social media will become more important, according to Eden Zoller, principal analyst at Ovum and author of the report.
“[In 2026,] you might start your research not necessarily through search; you might hop straight on to Facebook and ask your peers for recommendations and advice. You can use a mobile app in a store to ‘showroom’ – to do your price comparisons.
“Or you might go to your trusted digital assistant [such as Apple’s Siri] who uses artificial intelligence to recommend things to you, making selections and arranging purchase.”
For online furniture retailer Made.com, SEO is less of a priority than social media, with the brand unlikely to change what it has in its showrooms as a result of what people are searching for, says commercial director Annabel Kilner.
“It’s quite hard for retailers to change what they are doing in store to fit with trends they are seeing on search, [but] what we do know from historical data is what people buy at what time and therefore can make sure that [our] showroom reflects that.”
The brand launches two new collections a week and has three showrooms in the UK, focusing on paid social to promote itself and working with Criteo as a display advertising network.
“Paid social is key. We are a visual company, we are about design, and the great thing about paid social is that whether it is Pinterest, Instagram or Facebook, they lend themselves very well to beautiful imagery. I believe that our spend will increase exponentially in those channels versus something like Google’s paid search.”
For Rich Pleeth, an ex-Googler and founder of friend-finding app Sup, the future is SEO combined with ASO, or app-store optimisation. “Our budget for marketing is tiny; it’s all about making the product better, and the team. If you are really smart with SEO and ASO, and content, then you can do a great job without spending a huge amount of money.”
Jewellery business Nightingale is unusual in the UK: it sells diamonds that instead of being mined are made synthetically in a laboratory. Their chemical composition is exactly the same as ‘natural’ diamonds, but until recently their poor quality meant they were only suitable for industrial use, and not as gemstones.
But new techniques have changed this and a small number of labs are now making diamonds worldwide. This means the York-based jeweller, which sells online as well as having an office in the city, can tap into a niche but growing market for lab diamonds. With its unusual offering, it uses search marketing – organic and paid – to rank highly on results pages.
Discovering what people are searching for online also has an effect on what products the company stocks in-store. “Sometimes the quirks of search can affect aspects of that; for example, if a product is particularly popular online, or if we can be especially competitive, then that does change our priorities in terms of what we stock and what we buy in future,” says spokesperson Pete Wise.
Lab diamonds have recently attracted attention in the media, with headlines such as: ‘Would you buy a synthetic diamond?’ and ‘Would you propose with a lab-grown diamond?’ coming up when the term is searched for. As man-made gemstones are a new concept in the UK, Nightingale needs to provide extra information to people in the form of guides on its website. Wise advocates good-quality content to help consumers – as well as search engine rankings.
“It’s important to strike the right balance: it’s easy to take a website like ours and veer too far into becoming a digital publisher. What publishing on sites like ours should be about is transposing the knowledge that someone would get from a sales assistant in a shop onto a digital format. That perpetuates good relationships with customers.”
Wise explains that paid search works well for Nightingale, being an expensive product. “With a high-value product such as diamond jewellery it would be a shame to pass up that opportunity, because you don’t require a very high conversion rate to make some money. Paid search is also very good for increasing brand recognition, and that’s particularly important for a jewellery business.”
The brand is also able to get direct feedback from customers when they come into its shop as to how they found it – and the answer is often ‘through a Google search’. Nightingale is currently making a diamond ring for a customer in Austria who found the company in this way.
Brands that don’t match words with deeds when it comes to their impact on society face the threat of vigilante justice, with Greenpeace having forced brands such as Tesco, Lego and Waitrose to change their ways over recent years.
Maersk Line’s social media manager Davina Rapaport says that social media in companies should focus on what keeps a CEO awake at night, not simply likes and engagement.
UK department stores are failing to introduce omnichannel experiences at a pace that keeps up with consumer demand, new research finds, meaning they lag behind their US counterparts.
The UK’s richest 1% are more switched on digitally than their peers and many opt for mid-level goods over upmarket alternatives so brands may need to realign their thinking in order to target to this group effectively.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook’s vice-president of EMEA and Matt Brittin, president of Google EMEA, share their thoughts on the changing digital landscape and what it means for brands at Advertising Week Europe.
Nicola Mendelsohn: “[Brands should be] starting to test [virtual reality] but it’s very early days and not many people have these devices yet. It depends what your objective is. If your objective is testing innovation and being seen as an innovative company then try it because that would fulfil the objective. We only started shifting [the Samsung VR] in November, the Rift is only going out now, so is it actually in the hands of consumers? Not really, not at scale.”
Matt Brittin: “I encourage people in the UK, which is one of the most creatively advanced countries globally, to be experimenting with new stuff all the time. There’s only five million [Cardboard VR devices] out there but that’s in no time at all. People will want more immersive experiences… try to experiment with new technology, how does it help people to tell stories in new ways? [Virtual reality] is going to be really important for the industry.”
Nicola Mendelsohn: “We’ve used and built AI to give speech recognition as to the likelihood of what’s in a picture. If you’re a blind person and you’ve never been able to experience what is on Facebook, [when selecting an image] it will tell you ‘it looks like there is a man and a woman on a couch, they look happy’… You can see the look of delight of people’s faces and they say they can now speak to their family because they know what’s in the picture.”
Matt Brittin: “Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning is the future of computing, let’s be clear about that. It’s something that is really important… Machine learning underpins how we make search work, in actual language processing. So if you speak to Google our error rate has fallen from around 25% to around 5-6% in two years because of machine learning techniques. We can use fewer data points to give you more accurate results, faster… You can’t underestimate how transformational [machine learning] will be.
Nicola Mendelsohn: “We’re in the middle of a revolution with communications and technology. It’s very disruptive and quite frankly it’s a bit scary and when that happens people can move toward fear, and that’s normal. From previous revolutions we’ve seen that people are fearful, you hear about the demise of everything, [people worry] there will be no more jobs and the machines will take over, but that’s just not true.
“If you look at the history books you can see that with every revolution, yes things do change but there is much more employability, social mobility and creativity, and ultimately people are better off. Whatever job you do in communications at the moment it’s a choice – do you choose to be scared and fearful and stay as was, or do you choose hope and optimism and embrace the change?
“A lot will be the same – great storytelling, understanding the consumer and inspirational creative work – but actually can you combine that with other things to deliver things to people in a new and exciting way.
Matt Brittin: “I was in Eastern Europe in Prague recently and the attitude is all about protecting the future from the past. People have come from quite a difficult background and they are embracing the future and looking outwards and upwards. They are building technology skills; they have got amazing entrepreneurs in the digital space. When I spend time in some more Western European countries I feel the attitude is to protect the past from the future… At the moment if you look at what’s happening geo-politically, the Trump effect, I don’t like to mention what’s going on with Brexit here, or if you look at what’s happening with Putin, there is a danger of inward and backward looking rather than outward and forward looking.
Nicola Mendelsohn: “We’re all about value so we want to make sure that every pound and Euro being spent gives a better return back. We’re much more focused on making sure we can measure business value and outcome than we are on other areas.
“That is a shift from where the industry has been historically because it hasn’t always been as easy to do that as simply as it is to today. [Clients and agencies] are open to that conversation but it’s not without the need to make differences and changes. It’s very familiar to look back at things we’ve done historically as a benchmark but we should all be looking at how we can drive value.
Matt Brittin: “A lot of the time the old language and ways of thinking gets in the way. But if you try to focus entirely on what people are doing and think about how to connect with people it’s helpful. For example, my 16-year-old son could watch the same piece of content from five or six different platforms.H e could watch it on TV as it’s broadcast, on Netflix, on catch-up TV, on Amazon Prime or YouTube, and on one of a number of different devices, from his mobile, to a tablet, to his laptop, to a big TV screen. He can watch it five different ways and his eyeballs are currently worth five different prices. It’s nuts, so that has to change.
“It’s hard for all of us, the new players and the incumbents and the people in the middle. It means changing economic models and how we collect data, so let’s just think about what people are doing and think about what brands want to try and do with those people.
From ‘chatbots’ to social VR experiences, Facebook’s new features seem like an exciting way for brands to connect with consumers. But what should they consider before jumping in head first?
Facebook is partnering with the brains behind Tesco Clubcard, Dunnhumby, as it looks to show the impact advertising on the social network has on sales and increase its credibility among marketers by giving them the data to prove ROI.
The success of Google AdWords when it was launched 15 years ago was its simple premise of connecting consumers with content from advertisers that was exactly what they were looking for but Google is keen to move beyond this last click model to show brands how different devices play a role in a customers’ decision to purchase.
Fifty years of work could be lost to mental illness by 2030 – that’s about 12 billion working days – according to a recent World Health Organisation report. The survey also found that a failure to treat symptoms of depression and anxiety is costing the global economy £651bn a year in lost productivity.

The basic tenets of marketing are not changing, but with brands producing thousands of pieces of creative each year, a new framework is needed to ensure greatness.
We live in a world that is moving faster than ever. How consumers will interact with the digital world 18 to 24 months from now is highly uncertain.
Marketers are having serious conversations about artificial intelligence, not something you would have connected with our business a few years ago.
The speed of these changes does not require us to abandon the basic tenets of marketing: great understanding of the consumer, deep insights and positioning that connects with a higher purpose. But the way in which we achieve those long-cherished goals is changing significantly.
We need to develop the capacity to move faster. I am terrified by the agility of smaller companies that can move much faster than we can. What we need in the future is a lot more hunger and entrepreneurship, and that’s the huge risk for a big company like ourselves.
This need for agility also applies to creative output. We must maintain standards of excellence, despite the fact that we are producing more and more content.
Creativity is so important in a world where consumers can blot out your messages with increasing ease. One way to attract them is to be relevant as a brand and deliver messages that are truly inspiring to consumers.
Today, we produce more pieces of creative many more times than we did 18 months ago. Go 18 months into the future and that number will have increased many times over. To deliver that across more platforms, we are also working with more creative partners. If you are simply creating five big TV spots, you can ensure creativity in a particular way, but if you are producing thousands of pieces of creative, then you need a different framework for ensuring greatness.
That’s the challenge we are grappling with at the moment. I’m not saying we have achieved the holy grail but it involves the entire organisation.
Unless we are all committed to staying on top, no matter how much data we have, no matter how efficient we are at targeting every individual at the right time and right location, we will fail. We will only be relevant to consumers if we reach them in a creative and relevant fashion.
We need to build creativity into all aspects of our marketing and specifically into the way we are dealing with precision marketing and digital transformation.
The biggest decision we have made at Heineken is that precision marketing and creativity are two things that go hand in hand. The way that we developed our precision marketing programme, our entire approach to data, is very much interwoven with the way we talk  about creativity. That’s important because the big risk is that you have two tracks that do not come together.
We are shifting from a world where digital was a function within a department to a world where the marketing director has to be head of digital. In two or three years, I don’t think we will use the word ‘digital’ any more because digital is marketing.
READ MORE: Mark Ritson – ‘Digital marketing’ is redundant, so why create a separate budget for it?
We are moving towards a future where data is the foundation for all our marketing activities. It’s about the quality of the data we are able to collect and our ability to utilise that data to become increasingly granular in the way you talk to consumers.
One of the enduring messages we want to promote as a brewer in this digital world is our core belief that the world is a better place if people understand drinking in moderation. Living and committing to this brand purpose is increasingly important in a world where consumers can dig up the truth about your brand.
You simply have more fun with our products if you understand moderation and we believe very much that our role is to drive that agenda in a very big way and at all levels of society.
That’s what galvanizes us as an organisation. The moderation agenda means different things to people in the UK and Vietnam and will be articulated differently in these countries but the fundamental core idea persists at all levels of the company.
We only survive as a big drinks company if drink is something that is considered to have a positive role in society. If there’s a major negative side effect of what we are doing, then our outlook starts to look less positive.

Businesses frequently use the term, but what does it actually entail and who should be responsible for its execution?
The term ‘digital transformation’ has been used to describe anything from creating a fully responsive mobile website to developing a social media strategy, but in reality true transformation needs to involve much more than just the end product.
So what does this mean for brands? Whose responsibility should it be and what does a transformation project really involve? And what challenges do businesses face when adapting people and processes to new technology and shifting to a ‘digital first’ approach?
As digital now permeates every part of a business, many argue that it cannot be siloed. Marketing Week columnist Mark Ritson says as digital is indeed everywhere, “it’s impossible to find an Archimedean point where digital ends and so-called ‘traditional’ channels begin”. He also claims the death of ‘digital’ distinction is upon us, referencing Diageo’s CEO Ivan Menezes, who said: “It’s not about doing ‘digital marketing’, it’s about marketing effectively in a digital world.”
This casts doubt on the validity of having the word ‘digital’ in a job title because even though these professionals might take the lead on digital transformation projects, they should involve the entire business from the board to front-line staff.
“Digital transformation is another [term] for what I call business transformation,” says Thom Groot, digital director at car breakdown company The AA. “Digital is at the heart of businesses and in my view it’s a reflection of the fact that customer behaviour is changing. The digital age has accelerated that change and therefore businesses need to be fast at changing themselves to meet that customer behaviour.”
As digital transformation projects require input from the entire business, it is vital they get buy in from senior leaders and the board in order to be a success.
For The AA, a brand that has been around for 110 years, getting sign off from the board for changes of this kind can be difficult. Groot says: “Typically in companies that have been around for a long time there is an internal challenge about buy-in [and] if you don’t get that, it becomes hard to make an impact.”
He adds: “You need a vision of where you are headed and you need others to buy into it and engage with it, otherwise you will not get anything changed.”
A report titled ‘Effective leadership in the digital age’ by Marketing Week sister brand Econsultancy, which offers digital transformation consulting and services, shows that the responsibility for digital projects lies with senior leaders.
The research is based on 15 in-depth interviews with a range of C-suite and senior management professionals and an online survey of 439 senior staff across a range of organisations and sectors.
Three-quarters of respondents agree that the strategic digital priorities and direction of companies are the responsibility of the senior management. In 2013 it was 69%.
The proportion of organisations that believe setting digital budgets and targets is the responsibility of senior management has similarly increased, from 60% in 2013 to 70% in 2015.
However, a separate piece of research by agency Organic, shown exclusively to Marketing Week, reveals that 62% of staff feel the biggest barrier to digital transformation is not having a leadership mandate.
The survey of 111 digital and marketing professionals finds that 58% agree the C-suite are among the most valuable stakeholders in digital transformation projects; the same percentage say this for vice-presidents or heads of departments, while 57% single out directors.

While it may be challenging, as The AA’s Groot suggests, getting buy-in is vital, since 55% believe having no perceived need for change is the biggest barrier to digital transformation.
The approach and proposed benefits of any project, therefore, have to be tailored to senior leaders when trying to get buy-in. “Patience is a virtue, break it down to the language that the business is much more familiar with,” advises Dominic Rowell, commercial director at cinema chain Vue (see Top tips for digital transformation), who is working with digital agency TH_NK.
Vue is on a three-year road map to serve cinemagoers better through digital products and upgrades. Ahead of the release of the latest Star Wars film, for example, the cinema sold 10,000 tickets in the first 90 minutes of going on sale, so had to ensure the digital web experience met customers’ expectations.
The brand is in the foundation stages of the project but Rowell says breaking down the strategy into chunks helped sell the project to the business.
“It’s selling in strategic intent; a business plan that says ‘give me X and I’ll deliver Y’,” says Rowell. “When you are in an organisation where technology is full of unknowns, you don’t expect anybody to [ask for] millions in funding to [bet] on black and spin the wheel. Digital investment and transformation is how to break that vision down into digestible chunks [so] I can start to prove the business case.”
Vue can take this approach because digital is measurable, according to Rowell. He says the cinema chain can “keep learning and pushing towards short-term goals” that all contribute to its three-year plan.
Once senior leaders are on board, it is also important to ensure that any changes are shared with the rest of the company. Digital transformation is about adapting the culture of the business and the way it operates to work with new technology, rather than making the chosen technology stack fit.
The Organic research reveals that 30% of respondents believe transforming the culture of the organisation comes to mind when they think about digital transformation, while 24% say it refers to ‘ways of working’ compared to only 8% who believe the adoption of new IT is at the forefront of digital transformation.
People’s behaviour is changing because they can see there are better ways to organise their personal lives, their culture and work, says James Moffat, executive director at Organic. “In that respect, technology doesn’t drive change, it provides the opportunity to do things better.”
Moffat says a “people-centred approach” is best in digital transformation projects because the technology continuously evolves and “will be there today and gone tomorrow”.

Science-led biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca needed to engage staff in digital upgrades as their input was a key element of the project. The aim of the initiative, which was done with agency DigitasLBi, was to make digital channels work harder for the company’s partnership efforts and prospects, as the strategy is based on open innovation and partnering with the external world in science. This included a new corporate website and social media strategy.
“New websites and platforms are great but content is king,” says project director Roeland van der Heiden. This presented a challenge, as its content is created by the scientists themselves.
Van der Heiden says: “To build deep content means that you have to interfere with the scientists who are very busy. Getting everyone aligned to realign and produce the right content, and [getting] people to realise what the end result would be, that was the most challenging [thing].” He adds: “It’s building pride and belonging within the company. It gets easier and now everyone wants to be featured in the story.”
Creating a new internal way of working and communicating is part of the process. For example, oil company Shell wanted to introduce digital experiences to move from talking about what it sells – fuel – to focusing on customer passion points, such as driving, cars and motor sports.
The brand focused on its 60-year technical innovation partnership with Ferrari. Working with agency Iris, Shell created the Scuderia Ferrari Uncovered experience, which allows visitors to the site to digitally explore Ferrari’s Formula 1 garage via Google’s Street View.
Fiona Low, global head of digital marketing at Shell, says: “We want to tell the story of the science and innovation work we do with the Ferrari team [and how that] goes into the formulation that is available to you and I when we fill up [our cars] at the pump.”
She adds: “It took our teams out of their comfort zone because we weren’t directly talking about the products that we sell.”
Technology changes and develops simultaneously with customer behaviour so a vital piece of any transformation project is constantly checking if it serves a real customer need.
As The AA’s Groot says: “You have to start the process with what is going to be useful and valuable for customers and the business, as technology enables you to deliver what the customer wants.” But he warns: “Unless customers really want it and engage with it, you are not driving impact.”
Retail group Shop Direct needed to overhaul its operations to meet changing customer behaviour. Three years ago, 72% of the brand’s sales came from catalogue customers but now Shop Direct brands, such as Littlewoods.com and Very.co.uk, are 100% online and 63% of sales come from mobile devices.
“We have fundamentally changed our business,” says Gareth Jones, deputy CEO and retail and strategy director at Shop Direct. “We have focused more on our customers’ online journey through user experience, data analytics and personalisation. There is still work to do but we believe we’re well on the way.”
The business is also investing in new partnerships to support innovation. Working with omnichannel personalisation agency RichRelevance, for example, helps the brand offer customers a personalised and curated experience across its sites by delivering personalised product recommendations and offers.

Another example is a recent £50m investment programme in partnership with IBM, which will offer financial services products tailored to customers.
“New websites and platforms are great but content is king”
Many of these projects will have a set time frame, such as Vue’s three-year road map, but many will have no completion date because of the speed of development in digital technology and changing customer behaviour.
Therefore, there does not necessarily need to be a ‘big reveal’. Groot says: “There is a common misconception that you [do] a big project, deliver it [and say] ‘great, we are now transformed’, and it’s done. It’s never done.
“The long-term view should change, and should change often, because customer behaviour changes often.”
Van der Heiden echoes this sentiment. He concludes: “It is a continuous process, there is no one-off thinking. It’s not a project that will ever stop, so if you decide to be engaging in digital and social, there is a start but it doesn’t have an end.”
As part of its digital transformation, The AA is looking at its apps. It used to have more than 60 versions ranging from breakdown reporting to pub guides and aids to help learner drivers.
The apps were not unified and 74% of customers did not use an app again after download. Working with agency Rufus Leonard, The AA launched an app that tied up activities and services based on consumer needs.
Digital director Thom Groot says: “It has made a massive difference to the service we offer to customers. [There’s a] focus on making life easier for customers so they can call out [breakdown services] via the app, but also other services such as the nearest petrol station, the cheapest petrol, car registration, when you need an MOT or when your tax is due.”
The app development also led to teams working together and as the app develops, more is learned and incorporated. Groot adds: “You need different technology as a company to enable you to change faster, [and achieve a] faster speed to market.”
The project increased The AA’s app store rating from 2.5 to 4 stars, achieved a 37% increase in app visits and a 33% rise in unique users. It also generated a 113% increase in visits to its fuel price data section and doubled the number of people registering to use the app each week.

From ‘chatbots’ to social VR experiences, Facebook’s new features seem like an exciting way for brands to connect with consumers. But what should they consider before jumping in head first?
Speaking at Facebook’s annual global developer conference F8, CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed his plans for global expansion. Artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of ‘chatbots’ – that send live, automated messages via messaging apps – virtual reality and global connectivity were at the forefront of the agenda. Each venture undoubtedly brings opportunities for brands – but are they as exciting as Facebook would like us to believe?
Judging by the past couple of weeks, Messenger seems to be Facebook’s main focus for commercial expansion. Only last week it announced it would be rolling out new features on its Messenger app, allowing users who scan business codes to talk to brands directly. The app currently has over 900 million monthly users, but the majority are already friends. This development will see brands finally enter the equation.
Yesterday’s announcement, however, adds an AI aspect to the app. Facebook will be launching a developer platform for creating automated Messenger chatbots that, with the help of AI and natural-language processing, can conduct transactions and provide information. One of the first brands signed up to the service is media business CNN, which will be sending users tailored news updates. Other bots will be able to send users flowers with personalised messages, weather updates and shopping notifications through the Messenger app.

Meanwhile, Facebook will start making money from Messenger by letting companies buy News Feed ads that will take users directly to their bots, as well as being able to reach customers through sponsored messages.
At first sight, Facebook’s announcement sounds like a game changer by providing marketers with new opportunities to connect with customers.
“It’s creating a new marketing channel in itself. It will be good for brands to explore the channel as it will provide an extra touchpoint to connect with consumers before buying a product and can have a positive impact on brand perception and loyalty,” says Emmanuel Arendarczyk, managing director UK and France at digital marketing agency NetBooster.
However, brands shouldn’t abandon their websites and apps just yet because if they fail to produce a bot that can understand complex consumer queries, it can do more harm than good.
“If it’s a straightforward query, like getting the weather forecast or your daily horoscope, then it can work quite well,” he says.
“If you add something more sophisticated and it doesn’t work, it can be quite a frustrating experience for the user. So brands need to understand the technical limitations.”
As a result, the real success of the chatbot might not lie in the proven usefulness, but in its ability to mimic a user’s way of speaking.
“Real human connections are not always focused on the content of the story but instead on the essence of delivery – chatbots will need to prove themselves adaptable, and prove it quickly to users, to gather traction beyond the gimmick of ‘new’,” says Jenna Law, user experience director at brand consultancy Wolff Olins.
Besides updates to its Messenger app, Facebook also announced it was looking to provide an integrated VR and augmented reality headset that looks like a pair of glasses in 10 years. Earlier this month, the brand announced it would start shipping out the first commercial Oculus Rift VR headset this year.
Zuckerberg also reiterated Facebook’s interest in enabling social experiences via VR, but the initial VR app is predominantly focused on gaming. Nevertheless, he believes “a golden age of online video” is only just beginning.
While VR has been a buzz word for quite some time among brands, NetBooster’s Arendarczyk does see opportunities for sectors that are not linked to gaming – but there are limitations to its use.
“Part of Zuckerberg’s vision is to have VR-enabled ecommerce rolled out. For shoppers, it will be a new way to discuss products, explore different materials and get shop assistance. However, it all comes down to what is technically feasible. It needs a lot more investment and consumers will need to be equipped as well,” he says.
Another barrier will be whether the public will be comfortable picking it up. The immersive nature of VR means it can be unsuitable for certain brands and sectors.
“Brands will have to prove the attraction of being completely immersed in an experience. Not everyone will want to be completely shut out from others while shopping.”
Facebook’s final priority is global web connectivity. It plans to do this through
building autonomous drone planes and satellites and developing “terrestrial solutions” to bring the web to more people. In this case, the obvious opportunity for brands is to reach more people who otherwise would not have had access to their products and services.
Facebook’s new features are undoubtedly worth exploring for brands, providing new ways to connect to potential customers and develop existing relationships. However, iProspect’s Alistair Dent, head of product strategy, warns that “just because it’s new, doesn’t make the technology better”. For example, Google’s voice search did not pick up as much as it thought it would. Ultimately, it comes down to brands to provide the best possible user experience.
He explains: “We don’t know how well people will pick up that paradigm and embrace a new user experience. Whether users react well will come down to brands providing a good experience. If too many companies create bots and a VR version of their website when it doesn’t fit with their brand, users won’t ever pick it up.”
For brands to succeed, any new technology should enhance the customer experience as well as deliver ROI.
As Ranj Dale, head of technology research at GfK, concludes: “Always ask – what will it do for consumers? That’s at the heart of it and the biggest challenge for brands. People can get too caught up focusing on deploying technology just for the sake of it, but grounding it in consumer behaviour and needs is key to success.”
With Facebook adding new tools to its Messenger platform, including the ability to scan unique user codes to start a conversation, both brands and agencies expect the social media giant to develop into a clearer customer service tool.
Facebook has opened up its Messenger platform by announcing Messenger Codes, which allow brands to display codes that can then be scanned by users in order to start up an instant conversation via the one-on-one messenger platform.
Facebook’s partnership with Dunnhumby aims to improve its “credibility” among marketers by proving a link between advertising on the social network and both in-store and online sales but it faces challenges in getting brands to trust the data and must do more work to connect across the entire marketing ecosystem.
Mergers often cause more difficulties than synergies, but Dixons Carphone is swiftly growing profitability and its new group CMO Gary Booker is confident its disruptive approach to marketing will set it up for long-term success.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

Ahead of the Marketing Academy’s Inspire London event on 14 April, Marketing Week asks five millennial marketers and business owners to highlight how the role of leadership is changing and what today’s leaders need to do to adapt.
Harriot Pleydell-Bouverie, chief whisk, Mallow & Marsh – a confectionery brand that makes 100% natural marshmallows.
Leadership is ever-changing. In the same way that businesses are growing and morphing around new ideas, leadership needs to be nimble and react to those we lead.
As the young of today become the leaders of tomorrow we need to work with them, develop with them and tailor our leadership to them, as they will need to for those that they go on to lead.
Leadership is fluid, it flexes to suit those that need leading and at its best, it is almost undetectable. To me, the best leaders allow a team to lead themselves. They encourage people to set their own targets, grow at their own rate, and lead them by supporting their decisions, helping them to grow and inspiring them to be the best that they can be.
Rajeeb Dey, founder and CEO, Enternships – a portal that connects students and graduates to work placements in over 6,000 startups and SMEs
Millennials, probably more than any other generation, seek far more from their lives than just money and status. They are driven by a sense of purpose and meaning in their work and lives. Leaders should assess how the work they do helps foster a greater sense of purpose in their employees, as well as customers as this is one of the key factors to attracting the best talent, as well as being an expectation from customers of brands millennials engage with.
I would encourage future leaders to embrace uncertainty and recognise that we are only ever limited by our own imagination. There are undoubtedly many challenges facing the world but challenges also present opportunities. In the words of Gandhi we should “be the change we wish to see in the world”, so if there’s something you are not satisfied with – do something about it.
George Neel, marketing manager, Smirnoff (Diageo)
When I started my first job at a multi-national FMCG company I had no idea what made a good leader. There was a pretty hard culture and a hierarchal one at that. The senior leaders I saw were as inaccessible as they were impressive and I feared talking to some of them given their status and reputation within the business.
As I have progressed through my career I have encountered a wide range of leadership styles and I have been able to distil down what to me makes a great leader. Millennials want leaders who lead by service and inspiration, rather than hierarchy alone. Our leaders need to understand us as individuals, and understand our motivations in order to maximise our productivity and potential.
A senior leader in Diageo gave me the opportunity to lead a large scale project with autonomy, with the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them. What gave me the confidence and the ambition to succeed was the fact my leader was someone I wanted to work for, and who I wanted to impress. Crucially however, they were someone who I felt I could call upon when I needed, who didn’t tell me the answers but who showed me how to get to them. Ultimately leadership is the art of getting people to want to work for you.
Daianna Karaian, founder and CEO, Thoughtful – a content hub for ‘creative generosity’ 
To the leaders of today I say that true leadership has always been and will always be about setting an example for others through your actions. Integrity, for both people and brands, is about having complete alignment between what you say and what you do. It’s about identifying and articulating your values in a way that’s meaningful. As the lynchpin between a company’s words and its actions, marketing plays a key role in brand integrity. And, as a result, in leadership.
To the leaders of tomorrow I say be brave and be bold. Don’t be afraid to incite change, to express a point of view that goes against the grain, and to say what kind of impact you want to make before you’re even sure how you’ll do it. More often that not that’s what makes a positive difference in the world and in people’s lives. Having grown up with technology that demands ever-more transparency and authenticity, in a world that requires creativity and problem solving, you have what forward-thinking brands and organisations need.
Daniel Murray, co-founder, Grabble – an app designed to help users browse, save and purchase the latest fashion in one place.
To be taken seriously, leadership is something that needs to come from a place of authenticity. Therefore it’s very hard, in my mind, to do it well unless you are leading in an area or field you are thrilled to participate and lead in. The reality is that leadership has never really changed through the centuries or decades, and in many ways the fundamentals shouldn’t in the coming years either: you need to stand for something and you’ll attract the right people.
I think we are rapidly moving in a direction towards a completely new world where no-one can really predict the impact of things like artificial intelligence and virtual reality, and in those kinds of environments a conscious attempt for quality leadership that’s authentic and comes from good people with good intentions is going to be the most simple prerequisite of sustaining a peaceful, purposeful and ultimately profitable future for companies.
Despite not knowing what the future holds, the fundamentals of how to be a good leader then won’t be different to now – put others first and care for them. That’s all leadership has ever really been about and always will be.
Harriot Pleydell-Bouverie, Daianna Karaian, George Neel, Rajeeb Dey and Daniel Murray will be speaking on a panel called “Is leadership really changing?” at the Marketing Academy’s Inspire event on 14 April.
Burberry is the first brand to use a ‘Snapcode’ on Snapchat as it looks to give visitors in its stores access to exclusive content.
Facebook’s partnership with Dunnhumby aims to improve its “credibility” among marketers by proving a link between advertising on the social network and both in-store and online sales but it faces challenges in getting brands to trust the data and must do more work to connect across the entire marketing ecosystem.
Facebook is partnering with the brains behind Tesco Clubcard, Dunnhumby, as it looks to show the impact advertising on the social network has on sales and increase its credibility among marketers by giving them the data to prove ROI.
There is no point hiding from the fact the last general election was bad for political polling. But what does all of this mean to marketers who want to know where public opinion research goes from here?
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

ISBA held its annual conference yesterday (9 March) with hot issues including ad blocking, the government’s obesity strategy and the rise of vloggers all high on the agenda.
Speaking at the event, ISBA president and Britvic CEO Simon Litherland called on the industry to come together to tackle the various challenges facing the ad industry. He highlighted that trust in advertising remains “very low” among consumers, while the economic and political landscape are both leading to uncertainty over future growth and consumer spending power.
“There will be no let up on pressures in 2016,” he said.
Litherland highlighted a range of issues that will need cross-industry collaboration. One in particular that impacts his business, Britvic, is the government’s obesity strategy. Although this has been delayed until the summer, Litherland said it would be important “for all of us” because brands are able to make a real difference in promoting behavioural change.
“We need a holistic approach,” he said. “Advertising is not a driver of obesity. But advertising can promote behaviour change. Brands can reduce the sugar and calorie content of their products.
“More progress is needed and a commitment to a collaborative approach.”
On some of the issues facing digital advertising – ad fraud, online brand safety, data use and viewability – Litherland also called for cross-industry initiatives. He said that while ad blocking is a “fundamental challenge” to the marketing industry, it can be addressed with a pan-industry initiative.
“There is a cluster of significant issues that signal a significant workload is ahead. And all players must play their part in addressing them,” he concluded.
Culture secretary John Whittingdale has been vocal in his criticism of ad blocking and he reiterated these views at the conference, calling companies that run ad blockers “modern day Al Capones” for a business model that sees publishers able to pay to appear on whitelists.
He believes there are parallels between ad blocking and piracy, including the ways to tackle it. He said the industry needs to work on educating people and communicating the message that people can’t have something for nothing and on making ads more attractive and less annoying.
There will also be help from government, he said, as he proposed a roundtable to get all the players in the industry talking about the solution.
“Online there is an extraordinary range of services available – newspapers, apps, search engines. Google, Facebook and YouTube are part of everyday life and are all available to consumers for free, people don’t expect to have to pay for them,” said Whittingdale.
“But they have to understand that that content is the consequence of huge creativity and hard work and people have to be rewarded for it. That message needs to be more widely understood.”
However he said he wants the advertising industry to continue to self-regulate, highlighting how successful that strategy has been so far. He pointed to the fact that advertising is the second biggest creative industry in the UK, responsible for adding £10bn to the UK economy, 143,000 jobs and that growth is far above the economy as a whole.
“Like many other industries, [advertising] is something this country is extra good at. Some view advertising with suspicion and think it is brainwashing people to buy things they don’t want. I believe advertising is an essential component of a properly operating free market.”
Artificial intelligence will be able to mirror the human mind by 2029 according to Michael Florence, science author and the creative director at Manning Gottlieb OMD.
He told delegates that brands must stop looking at AI as a sci-fi term and start to prepare for a world where they will have to create marketing campaigns that appeal to machines as well as humans.
“Google has spent $500m on their secret AI Deep Mind research project so it’s clear the rise of the machines is no longer just confined to Terminator 2 and Sky Net,” said Florence. “If AI machines will become as clever as humans and if virtual personal assistants will become the norm by 2020 then brands must start to think about designing their advertising to appeal beyond humans.”
And if marketers are to get to grips with AI, they will have to be prepared to unlearn everything they’ve been taught.
In a later presentation, L’Oreal’s UK CMO Hugh Pile advised: “As marketers we must learn how to unlearn as not everything we’ve been taught is applicable in 2016 or will be next year either. We have to be like water and adapt to our surroundings.”
Many marketers are missing out on a chance to hit millions of engaged young consumers by taking the wrong approach to the world of vlogging. That was the view of Dominic Smales, managing director of Gleam Futures, an agency which manages popular YouTube stars such as Caspar Lee and Zoella.
He said many still ‘ignorantly’ tag the likes of Zoella as a “bedroom hobby” for an “unengaged audience of purely under-18 year olds.”
Smales countered: “These are just myths as 80% of the people who watch the Gleam roster are over 18 and hugely engaged.
“Not enough brands are partnering with vloggers as they are ignorant to the realities. They are really missing out.”
He was joined on stage by internet star Caspar Lee, who has nearly six million YouTube subscribers and a published book to his name.
Lee advised brands: “Vloggers aren’t going to just endorse a product as it will make us lose some of our truth and authenticity. If you want to work with us, you have to understand that you have to give up some control and you can’t just edit us.”
ISBA and the IPA have warned that brands are still not properly considering the ramifications of social media use.
Marketing Week’s key takeaways from ISBA’s Annual Conference, including the decline of consumer trust in the advertising industry, the perks and pitfalls of the use of vloggers by brands and preventing crisis in the online world.
Both industry bodies and ad blockers have reacted to comments yesterday (2 March) by culture secretary John Whittingdale, who referred to ad blocking as a ‘modern-day protection racket’.
Waitrose’s outgoing managing director Mark Price sought to play up the quality of its products “day in day out” versus the less consistent quality on offer at the discounters as he admitted the grocer needed to do more to explain to people the difference between a £5 lobster from Aldi or Lidl and a £10 one from Waitrose.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month, futurists and tech enthusiasts were debating the bleeding edge of consumer technology, with the internet of things (IoT) taking centre stage.
Scroll forward to Super Bowl Sunday earlier this month and that same technology was popping up in ad breaks alongside Budweiser and Doritos in the form of Amazon’s Echo speaker and voice-activated hub, equipped with the brand’s Alexa artificial intelligence system.
The internet of things, where everyday objects and appliances connect to the internet and one another, is increasingly woven into the fabric of daily life. The only danger is that there is no guarantee today’s technological obsession will be tomorrow’s routine habit. So how wise is it for marketers to invest in something that might turn out to be a fad?
Mariano Dima, global CMO at holiday rental website HomeAway, says for his brand: “There are three areas that are pain points or problems which can be solved by IoT innovation: energy efficiency within the home; convenience, where our customers have to be able to provide access to their properties in the right place at the right time; and enhanced booking through systems such as Apple TV.”
Dima explains that IoT could have a significant effect on both his major customer groups – the hosts renting out their homes through HomeAway – and the holidaymakers using it to book the accommodation. Security, he notes, is often a number-one concern for both parties and so by encouraging hosts to adopt IoT-enabled locks for their homes, peace of mind is assured.
“Many owners are starting to install wireless locks. You can download an app every time you book that provides all the information about the house – from the wireless [internet account details] to where local amenities are – but importantly the owner can provide you with a code that unlocks the door. This code can change for each user of the property. It’s secure and convenient,” he says.
For Dima, the value in IoT is that by delivering peace of mind for both customer sets, he is able to grow not only his own business but the category as a whole. He identifies security concerns as being the biggest hurdle to potential customers trying out the service, but notes that once someone experiences renting through a ‘sharing economy’ site such as HomeAway, 84% will return to let a whole property.
However, the proliferation of connected devices and objects, and the additional services they make possible, creates a huge increase in business complexity for brands. A significant digital theme for 2016 is data security – given the number of high-profile hacks in 2015 and the more stringent data protection laws agreed in the EU – and yet here are devices that do not just collect and use the first-party data for themselves but exist potentially to share that data between other companies. Data is even shared between companies that in the past may have seen each other as competitors.
Director of innovation at Npower Neil Pennington gives the example of the energy supplier’s partnership with Google-owned smart thermostat system Nest. Although he argues that the association with Nest is “credible” and that they are bringing “great technology”, he also acknowledges that it requires an unfamiliar approach for the sector.
“Large utilities do get obsessed with brand and the idea that we have to own the whole thing, that our brand has to be stamped on everything. But in a more complex world of data and the need for different companies across different verticals to collaborate, we move into the realm of the ecosystem,” he says.
Aviva’s global analytics director Adam Kornick believes that much can be achieved by maximising that most ubiquitous of connected ‘things’ – smartphones. “With a third party we are using weather information to make our flood models better,” he says.
“We’re getting better predictions from those who have opted into that programme using the weather app. Smartphones are often overlooked. We interact every day via smartphone and those are the original internet of things. Our speed app [for Aviva’s car insurance also] measures your driving and gives you a discount. Lots of companies have that opportunity to gather information and deliver something useful back to the customer,” he adds.
Indeed, there can be a tendency to overthink potential IoT strategies by gravitating towards every new device. For some of the most innovative ideas, the simplest solutions using channels already open to brands are the most effective. Although HomeAway is exploring the use of Apple TV to expand its booking platforms, for delivering bespoke in-stay content or personalised channels Dima believes that there is more than enough functionality simply via mobile.
“We are empowering our travellers through our mobile hospitality app. They can get interesting information about local wine and restaurants with content created by local hosts,” says Dima.
The format that a brand’s interactions with customers takes in the IoT ecosystem depends on the desired strategic outcome. There are two routes to engaging via IoT – passive and active.
Passive IoT technologies include Nest’s connected home appliances and British Gas’s smart thermostat Hive, where there is opportunity to interact by manually adjusting heating and lighting but, by and large, the systems simply make intelligent modifications under the radar.
An active IoT strategy involves interaction such as Aviva’s Drive app to encourage behaviour change – in this case safe driving – or any one of the many fitness wearables that encourage users to take more steps to gain badges or clock up more calorie allowance in associated diet apps such as MyFitnessPal.
The issue with more active IoT engagement is that it is dependent on the consumer’s ongoing enthusiasm. There is a danger with gamification or goal-oriented use that, once achieved, engagement falls off a cliff. But Aviva’s Kornick downplays this risk.
“If we want to build models of customer behaviour, then information from passive sources is great. But if the company’s desire is to have interaction between the customer and the brand, this approach won’t work.” In insurance, the need to interact with customers on a more regular basis is a hot topic as the industry is keen to move away from just two customer interactions – renewal and claim – to build better, less price-sensitive relationships.
To solve the problem of diminishing engagement with IoT offerings over time, Kornick suggests ignoring the ‘if you build it, they will come’ approach. Kornick believes the reverse to be true: “I do not often recommend this. Knowing what we can do to help the customer is a better place to start. We can state that we will help them to be healthier rather than offering them a blood pressure monitor.”
The internet of things is not limited to smarter ways to provide services to customers; objects are starting to have conversations with each other. Spirits brand Absolut will be experimenting with IoT this year and its collaboration with consultancy SharpEnd has led to a number of proposals.
“Thresholds and pain points are something we’ve been exploring: how much is the consumer ready to get involved with brands and download things or activate codes on the mobile phone? We will see more frictionless and seamless activations,” claims Absolut’s digital innovation manager Markus Wulff.
He is reluctant to reveal what 2016’s innovations may include but says the company has been looking at how to work with Philips Hue lighting systems, Sonos speakers and Nest. “We can’t go into details about what we will execute and activate this year,” he states, “but we have several different technologies that could be integrated.”
These could include image recognition to understand loyal customers and unlock vouchers; trackable products to improve the supply chain; or ways of branching into entertainment through augmented reality or connection to sound systems.
Wulff reveals that an active element of the IoT strategy could somehow involve triggered invitations to local brand events, while more passive elements engage the home environment to include sound and light experiences.
He adds: “There is a curve when it comes to teaching customers about IoT. In a few years’ time there will be many objects that can connect with each other but right now we are focusing on three key areas: smart packaging, activations for real world brand experiences and the connected home.”
Neil Pennington, Director of Innovation, Npower
The smart home has been around for years but it’s a case of over-promising and under delivering.
It was typified by buying a big, integrated, white plastic solution for a lot of money that had to be programmed and remained largely the realm of the gadget geek.
But technology is becoming much more usable and less intrusive. And customers are more demanding of the services and the benefits they get. It’s driven by the experience of smartphones and tablets – once you set it up, you expect it to connect every time.
It’s no surprise that Nest [the Google-owned smart thermostat, with which Npower has a partnership] should come from former Apple executive Tony Faddell. It has a design-oriented and simplistic approach. There may be three major products associated at the moment – thermostat, carbon monoxide monitor and camera – but there are 12,000 developers working in the Nest ecosystem from locks to washing machines. More importantly, it all works in the background, there is no need to interact with it.
The real challenge for us as an energy company is how to get at the emotion of our customers. Security of homes and families is about wellbeing. If their Nest Protect alarm goes off, there is an opportunity there to provide useful interventions for customers. Those user cases chime with people beyond simply energy saving.
Customers are becoming less cognisant of business verticals. Ultimately, the companies that build their experience are Amazon or Uber and so they’re expecting more personalisation and value to come across product categories.
The integration of Nest with cameras can open up different opportunities around security, which leads to insurance as well as energy benefits. Perhaps we will see the rise of the lifestyle company where we help run the customer’s life as opposed to giving them different ways to pay a bill.
Interesting to see this article published as MWC starts. The current situation with the IoT appears similar to the challenges faced by the Mobile industry with regards to Data & Multimedia Services as they began the rollout of 3G networks. If you ask consumers what they expect their homes to look like in 20 years they’ll undoubtedly talk about the changes in connected tech – but it’s the route to get there that will be fascinating to navigate. In order to deliver the growth and commercial potential, trusted brands need to be developed to enable consumers to safely experiment with this new type of tech & service.
As the Consumer Electronics Show kicks off in Las Vegas, we take a look at the tech and trends that could have a big impact on marketers’ businesses over the coming year.
Financial technology brands are shaking up what has been a stuffy and inaccessible industry by meeting changing consumer demands head-on, and marketers stand to learn a great deal from their disruption.
With virtual reality set to become a $1bn industry in 2016 marketers are switching on to the technology as the next big content marketing medium.
The great and the good of the marketing world were at this week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona where tackling mobile ad blocking, the rise of virtual reality and redefining the smartphone were high on the agenda.

Although mobile strategies are beginning to mature there are several pain points that continue to frustrate marketers.
“It is clear that consumers have shifted to mobile and businesses must know they need to catch up,” declared Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg on an earnings call last month. “Marketers are realising if they want to reach their customers where they are, then mobile is essential.”
Sandberg’s warning was all the more startling when accompanied by the announcement that Facebook’s mobile ad revenue soared by 81% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of last year to $4.5bn (£3.1bn) – or 80% of total ad revenue. Only three years ago, mobile accounted for around 20% of the social network’s ad revenue.
The business implications of mobile’s rapid surge will occupy delegates during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week (22-25 February). In addition to the unveiling of new smartphones, wearable devices and virtual reality headsets, business leaders will debate how changing consumer behaviour on mobiles is reshaping their industries, and how they must respond if they are to stay relevant.
Ahead of the congress, Marketing Week has drawn up five key problem areas that marketers must address if they are to succeed in the transformational world of mobile.
Recent research by app developer Apadmi shows that only 11% of UK consumers have downloaded their favourite retailer’s app, while 59% agree that apps do not complement or co-ordinate with the in-store and online shopping experience.
Consumer apathy towards apps is becoming increasingly challenging for brands as mobile use matures. Most smartphone owners have developed fixed patterns of behaviour and as a result, new brand offerings are frequently ignored. For example, Forrester Research finds that the average UK smartphone owner spends 89% of their app time on just five apps: Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Stocks and Maps.
Breaking into this pantheon of favoured apps is a nigh-on impossible task for most brands and particularly those with limited budgets. For the average app, almost 60% of users become inactive within 30 days, according to Localytics, while data from Quattra shows the daily active user rate drops 77% the first three days after installation. Instead of assuming apps are the answer, marketers need to think more creatively about how they can reach and engage with consumers on mobile.
Top of the list of priorities is enhancing the mobile web experience, which has come to play an increasingly prominent role in the fortunes of all brands. Google changed its algorithm last year to favour mobile-optimised sites in search rankings in an update dubbed ‘mobilegeddon‘ because of its negative effect on non-optimised sites. The new algorithm rates sites according to various criteria including the legibility of text on mobile screens, the ease of navigation within mobile sites and page loading times. A study at the time by website TechCrunch found that 44% of Fortune 500 companies in the US had mobile sites that fell foul of Google’s criteria.
With most consumers using search – rather than apps – to find the content they want, mobile web experiences have a huge bearing on how effectively marketers can reach their target customers. Google has made further updates since mobilegeddon, including a feature that supports push notifications in web browsers, not just apps.
Forward-thinking brands are also turning their attention to messaging apps, as they look to serve customers in the apps where they spend most of their time. Last year, American retailers Everlane and Zulily became the first brands to use the Facebook Messenger app as a customer service platform, while Dutch airline KLM plans to offer booking confirmation and boarding passes via the app. Meanwhile, shoe retailer Clarks used WhatsApp last year to share direct messages with consumers to celebrate the history of its desert boot.
One of the most significant features of Apple’s latest mobile operating system, iOS 9, is an option that allows iPhone users to block mobile adverts. Within a day of the new system’s release last September, ad blockers soared to the top of the app chart, signalling consumers’ desire to avoid annoying or intrusive mobile ads.
At that time, Tumblr co-founder Marco Arment launched – but later withdrew – ad blocking app Peace. He said upon its release: “Web advertising and behavioural tracking are out of control. They’re unacceptably creepy, bloated, annoying, and insecure, and they’re getting worse at an alarming pace. Ad and tracker abuse is much worse on mobile.”
According to Arment it became the “number one paid app in the US App Store for about 36 hours” but he withdrew Peace just two days after its launch, arguing that “a more nuanced, complex approach” to ad blocking was needed.
The practice of ad blocking has generated plenty of controversy, following complaints from publishers that it deprives them of vital advertising revenues needed to sustain their free content.
While the debate rages on, it is clear that marketers need to rethink their approach to mobile advertising and meet the demand for less annoying or data-draining ads. This is imperative as brands allocate significantly greater funds to mobile this year. Research by eMarketer predicts that in 2016 the global mobile advertising market will surpass $100bn (£69bn) and account for more than 50% of all digital ad spend for the first time.
Daniel Rosen, global director of advertising at telecoms group Telefónica, which owns the O2 brand in the UK, believes that the growth of programmatic trading on mobile – where ads are served automatically according to different data points such as location or browsing history – is helping to improve the consumer experience. Two years ago, Telefónica launched its own ad network Axonix, which has access to Telefónica customers’ first-party data.
“Brands can definitely deliver more contextually relevant messages – we are only scratching the surface of what’s possible at the moment,” says Rosen. “The technology is there, the data is there, so the opportunity is there too.”
Smartphones are intensely personal devices, yet recent research shows that UK marketers lack confidence in their personalisation strategies. The survey by digital agency Greenlight finds that 88% of marketers believe their brand is lagging behind competitors in their use of personalisation, while only 24% say they personalise on mobile devices.
To overcome this challenge, brands and publishers are searching for ways to better personalise the mobile experience. Earlier this month, publishing group Time Inc launched Powder, a “mobile-first beauty service” that aims to provide personalised editorial content and product recommendations according to users’ needs and mobile behaviour.
Visitors to the Powder mobile site can create their own personal beauty profile, which allows the service to deliver bespoke advice and product recommendations based on the information they provide. It takes into account a range of personal characteristics such as age, skin type, make-up preferences and price points. Users can then purchase recommended products or save them in a ‘virtual beauty drawer’.
Time Inc digital director Rich Sutcliffe highlights the opportunity for advertisers to deliver targeted product sampling and native advertising via the platform. For example, different mobile video ads are delivered according to personal profiles to provide a greater level of targeting. Beauty brand L’Oréal Luxe is the UK launch partner for Powder.
“[Powder] is a utility, so it has to provide the user with useful information,” says Sutcliffe. “There are already millions of beauty ‘how-tos’ online, so we’re not breaking new ground in that respect, but because it feels very native to the product and is done in a premium way, it’s a much better approach than just throwing a load of ads onto what is essentially a small screen.”
L’Oréal Luxe managing director Amandine Ohayon agrees that the ability to deliver personalised messages is a key attraction for the brand. “A tailored, personalised approach to beauty on mobile is what interested us and we have gained deeper insight into customer behaviour as a result,” she says.
Many brands have not yet grasped the market research potential of mobile. This is partly due to a lack of imagination on the part of marketers in thinking about how their mobile activity might have an effect on consumers’ non-mobile behaviour, and vice-versa.
It may also be a resources issue, as such research projects often require significant investment that not all brands can afford. Last year, for example, electronics retailer Dixons Carphone revealed the results of a massive research project with Google that aimed to quantify the relationship between its spend on search marketing and its offline sales.
This involved creating a ‘ROPO’ (research online, purchase offline) study that cross-referenced two years’ worth of the retailer’s sales and media spend data with Google’s search spend data. From the resultant statistical model, it was discovered that for every online sale achieved through paid search, Dixons Carphone achieved three offline sales. This helped the retailer identify the extent to which people were using mobiles to research products before purchasing in-store, which in turn enabled it to adjust its investment in mobile search to boost sales and return on investment (ROI).
There are other examples of new research models that are helping marketers to quantify the effect of their marketing spend via mobile. Research group Ipsos has created a proprietary technology called MediaCell that passively measures the TV, radio or online ads people have been exposed to via an app on their mobile, rather than relying on their recall. It uses audio matching to record how often the person is exposed to a campaign, and serves follow-up survey questions.
Forrester Research predicts that most brands will under-invest in mobile this year because “too many marketers have a narrow view of mobile as a sub-digital media and channel”. Its 2016 Mobile and App Marketing Trends report finds that only 20% of marketers feel their companies are investing enough in mobile, while just a third say they are confident about how to measure mobile ROI.
“While most brands are trying to mobilise their ads, few are going the extra mile: serving their customers in their mobile ‘moments’ by transforming the entire customer experience,” suggests Forrester analyst Thomas Husson.
He also predicts that mobile will play a key role in facilitating the most exciting emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality (VR) and the internet of things. “In  2016, smartphones will activate [these technologies] and enable business-to-consumer marketers to innovate,” suggests Husson.
Media reports last week suggested that Google is developing a new smartphone-based VR headset for release later this year. Google’s existing Cardboard VR product enables the user to slot their smartphone into the headset and experience VR thanks to sensor technology in the phone. The new product is expected to have a solid plastic casing and will be accompanied by updated Android technology.
Meanwhile, Samsung recently sought to take a lead on connected technology by launching its own internet of things home hub. The brand claims it offers secure but open protocols for connecting a range of smart home devices, all of which are accessible via a smartphone app. Samsung has predicted that the internet of things will become an increasingly mainstream phenomenon over the next five years.
Mobile World Congress next week promises to herald more such advances (see Innovations to look out for, below) – and further examples of how the smartphone will continue to drive this technological revolution.
In this context, Husson argues that leading brands must make mobile a core priority this year.
He says: “In 2016, [the] growing minority of leading marketers will start to fully integrate mobile into their marketing strategies.”

With the exception of Apple, which is reportedly planning to unveil a new iPhone in mid-March, all of the world’s major smartphone makers will be out in force at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week (22-25 February). Samsung is holding its now customary press event on the Sunday evening before the congress, where it is expected to launch the Galaxy S7 smartphone. Sony and LG are also planning announcements, with new wearable and virtual reality devices likely to feature.
5G roadmap
At last year’s MWC, industry leaders said the next generation of mobile internet – 5G – could be running by 2018. With its promise of a tenfold increase in data transmission speeds compared to 4G capabilities, 5G is seen as vital to facilitating new connected technologies such as driverless cars. This year, senior executives from global telecom groups like Deutsche Telekom and smartphone makers such as Huawei will discuss the technology roadmap and consumer applications of 5G.
Internet of things
Expect to see more of the connected appliances with which we are now so familiar – from smart thermostats to smart fridges – but also more details on how home hub packages and brand partnerships will help to take connected technology mainstream. Google will have a big presence at MWC 2016 and is also co-sponsoring an IAB event at the congress featuring speakers from diverse companies such as BMW, Visa and Unilever.
As social media becomes more about value than volume and brands increasingly look to link online and offline channels through live events, Marketing Week outlines the media topics that will define 2016.
Marketers are increasingly buying mobile programmatically but there remains a “clear disconnect” between usage and brands’ understanding of the technology, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB).
Despite the rapid increase in social media ad budgets, many senior marketers remain unconvinced by its impact on their firm’s overall performance and are still failing to integrate it into their wider marketing strategies.
Marketing Week and marketing cloud provider Salesforce brought together experienced professionals in marketing and data to uncover the biggest issues in customer experience and how to attack them.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

A new world of emotion tracking technology such as Emotient, recently acquired by Apple, will enable brands to measure at scale how emotionally engaged customers are with ads and use that information to develop marketing that is more likely to resonate.
The video ‘view’ has seemingly become the measure of how successful a piece of digital video is. Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe, when discussing the supermarket’s Christmas ad campaign featuring Mog the cat on a recent press call, used YouTube views to back up his claim that it was the most successful supermarket campaign ever.
The campaign has indeed reached millions of people. Almost 30 million have watched ‘Mog’s Christmas Calamity’ since it went live on 12 November. But is this really a good measure of success? Just because people watched a video does it mean it resonated with them?
That is the question that the new generation of emotion tracking technologies is trying to answer.
The latest news in this area comes from Realeyes. It has signed a deal with MediaCom to give its clients, including Coca-Cola, Volkswagen and Procter & Gamble, the ability to measure people’s emotions through webcam recordings. The tie-up comes hot on the heels of Apple’s acquisition of Emotient – an artificial intelligence technology that similarly analyses facial expressions and uses the data to determine people’s emotional response to ads.
There are already a number of services available for tracking the thoughts and feelings of people that have viewed an ad. Brain Juicer, for example, uses consumer panels to determine emotional reaction. More recently, viral video service Unruly has launched its ‘Future Video Lab’ which aims to provide real-time data on the emotional triggers that drive an effective video distribution strategy.
But Realeyes’ and Emotient’s newer offerings have been hailed as landmark deals for emotion tracking. Previously it could only be used on a small scale but Apple’s and MediaCom’s involvement opens it up to a whole new audience.
David Carr, strategy director at digital agency DigitasLBi, says: “It is interesting to see these solutions being used at scale. If they can get a large body of evidence and then allow brands to mine and benchmark their own campaigns it could be very powerful.”
The deals are part of a wider movement aimed at reassessing what drives ad effectiveness. Carr adds that they aim to finally provide the data that the ‘man men’ of the 1970s were looking for when they shifted marketing from being about product to about brand – as Coca-Cola did with its ‘I’d like to buy the world a Coke’ ad.
There appear to be two main uses for emotion data. The first is in pre-testing ad campaigns and is the main focus for Realeyes at the moment.
For example, brands that have created longer-form content could test which sections would work best as a teaser to get people watching the full video. It could also be used to work out if different soundtracks produce different emotional responses or if a particular scenario produces a bigger emotional response in one market than another.
“This technology enables us to predict how well assets will do. It enables us to stop campaigns and gives us the knowledge to know if a given asset is even good enough to air.”
“It has already saved our clients quite some money in terms of us pulling the plug on campaigns. And it helps us by knowing how good an asset is so we know how much we can rely on organic reach or if we need to pay our way through. That’s how it works in the media planning phase.”
The technology could also help brands work out which consumers to seed content with, or when to stop showing the ad.
“An advertiser’s goal is never to serve as many ads as possible but to serve them only to people who might be receptive. Most digital platforms use algorithms to judge which ads users don’t like, and stop running those ads. This sort of technology is an extension of that system: if you don’t like my ad, I don’t want to show it to you anymore,” explains Alistair Dent, head of product strategy at iProspect.
While there are clear uses for emotion tracking technology within the digital space, in future it could be used across media.
That has already started in outdoor advertising. At Birmingham’s main train station, New Street Station, Ocean Outdoor has erected digital screens that track the age and sex of passers-by in order to show more relevant advertising.
Catherine Morgan, head of creative solutions at Ocean Outdoor, says the technology is 98% accurate on gender and between 85% and 90% accurate on age groups. Advertisers can then set a threshold to say they only want their ad shown if the audience is 60% female or 40% over the age of 30.
The technology can also be used to work out how many are looking at the screen and how long for. It is not hard to imagine a future where technology can track if people passing by are tired and offer them cups of coffee, or stressed and offer them some light entertainment.
However, amid all the excitement about emotion tracking technology and what the data could tell brands about the effectiveness of their creative, marketers should not forget to trust their instinct, says Carr.
“Hopefully marketers will still occasionally go with their guts. The most famous adverts – Gorilla from Cadbury, Surfers from Guinness – would all have failed in pre-testing.
“The technology might have a big body of data behind it but is has to learn over time. Nothing is 100% foolproof. This data provides useful benchmarks and comparisons and the data to prove the effectiveness of what we feel in our gut. But as with all good things the true test will be in how it’s used.”
People’s facial reactions are recorded through their webcams with their consent. These are streamed to Realeyes’ cloud servers, where they’re securely processed – low-quality recordings are filtered out and the expressions analysed are by extracting data from 49 key facial points.
Six key emotions are measured – happiness, surprise, sadness, disgust, fear and confusion – which are then also used to measure engagement as well as overall positivity and negativity.
The results are aggregated and reported in an online dashboard in near-real time, enabling clients to make better and quicker business decisions.
A couple of hundred people are usually tested per video and they can be tested across 60 countries.
Spotify is to launch its “most concerted” global marketing effort to date to support the development of its ‘Year in Music’ initiative as it looks to keep people engaged by promoting music in the same way broadcasters promote TV shows.
Programmatic and digital advertising is increasingly about the data but many brands are concerned they are losing the emotional touch. At Quantcast’s Supernova event in London today (21 October) Lloyds explained how it wants to make its digital advertising as emotive as its TV campaigns while the agency behind John Lewis’ ads explained why data is not the answer to everything.
As it reaches its 60th birthday, UK TV advertising has evolved from being information-heavy to prioritising clever creative that triggers emotion and uses humour to entertain viewers. Targeted content that can transfer across different screens and marketing channels is also rising up the agenda, thanks to changing consumption habits and new technology for media buying. […]

With 12 million active users of ad blockers, marketers will need to think about how to use media creatively to ensure their advertising reaches the right audience in 2016.
Consumers have been blocking ads ever since they could turn a page in a newspaper or change channel using a television remote control.
Yet it is the rise in the use of ad blocking technology on digital devices which is making marketers nervous and prompting some careful analysis of how they should allocate their advertising budget during 2016.
According to PageFair, which measures the impact of ad blocking, the estimated cost to publishers was nearly $22bn during 2015. There are now around 198m active ad block users around the world, with the trend in the UK growing by 82 per cent in 12 months to reach 12m active users.
Publishers are fighting back in different ways. Financial newspaper City AM is trialling banning readers from its website if they use ad blockers, pointing out the commercial implications for its business.
Despite the rise in the use of ad blocking technology there is no evidence it will stop brands from advertising this year, but marketers will look more closely at where they spend their money.
Director of communications at the Advertising Association, Ian Barber, cites the AA/Warc Expenditure forecast figures that predict total ad spend will grow by 5.8 per cent this year and break the £20bn mark. “Traditional channels like TV and out of home (OOH) should perform strongly and internet spend will again break double figures with a forecast of 12.5 per cent growth for 2016,” he says.
TV will remain popular for advertisers that need to reach mass audiences. The total weekly reach of TV for adults was 95% in December, says marketing body Thinkbox, with commercial telly’s share of linear viewing at 66.3%.
Advertisers must be smarter when producing and delivering content online or offline this year. It will mean more investment in artificial intelligence to reach the most receptive consumers, and increased use of video content and strong images to help brands with their storytelling.
The trend towards moment marketing around key TV shows, news, sporting and weather events to get digital cut-through should accelerate this year. This will mean a boost in revenue for leading social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Brands will continue to improve personalisation and make more use social media messaging apps. Products such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp will be used to send relevant offers to consumers to avoid the ab blockers.
Personalised advertising will also stretch increasingly into the home via smart devices and the wider adoption of the Internet of Things.
There could also be more targeted email marketing this year.
Exeter-based The Gro Company manufactures sleep products for young children and uses cloud-based software from supplier Bronto to take a data-led approach to email marketing. This enables the brand to segment its audience and ensure content is relevant and engaging as children move from being babies to toddlers.
Its Seven Days of Christmas email marketing campaign helped online sales for December increase by 57 per cent year on year, according to group ecommerce manager Edward Scott-Finnigan. The company will also book press advertising in parenting magazines to build trust among parents.
It is relevancy, a respect for privacy and a better understanding of each brand’s target audience that will create trust for advertisers and ensure consumers remain receptive to a brand’s message, wherever they see it.
Advertising must at least appear to be less intrusive, so expect more investment in augmented reality and virtual reality advertising in 2016.
Offline, direct mail will also be popular this year because it sidesteps the digital fatigue many people feel.
Rachel Aldighieri, managing director at the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), says consumers will only want to block ads if they perceive the messaging as irrelevant. She adds that marketers must therefore ensure they do not put too much emphasis on technology at the expense of the creative.
Life insurer Sun Life is combining content marketing and direct mail this year as it attempts to make advertising and marketing more entertaining and move budget away from online advertising in 2016.
“We have ‘the best answer to someone’s question’ on our website and are adding value with free tools such as our interactive savings calculator and our new ‘perfect send-off’ service that lets people record their wishes for their funeral,” says head of brand Ian Atkinson. “We also create entertaining videos, like our recent pet insurance videos, which our audience can engage with by commenting on them and sharing.”
Atkinson says direct mail remains the most valuable channel for cross- and up-selling to existing customers and the brand mails about 14m packs a year.
“There’s also the haptic consideration. Mailings are tactile and give recipients an opportunity to play with the medium,” he says. “We can also include physical items which make the message more engaging or which give customers some value, such as when we included SunLife-branded trolley tokens in a mail campaign.”
The digital OOH market will also be doing its best to woo advertisers this year, especially those keen to reach smart phone users. There is likely to be an increased budget for Bluetooth beacon technology, for instance.
“With OOH you cannot fast-forward or swipe an ad away, so technology is enhancing this medium which is a part of society and not intrusive,” says Alan Brydon, the CEO of trade body Outsmart. “We are showing advertisers how OOH encourages the use of connected devices.”
Carlton Daniel, media and advertising partner at legal firm Squire Patton Boggs, says the debate this year will be less about moving from online to direct mail, OOH, TV, radio or press, and more about how advertisers combine their use of different media by making the most of their data.
“For example, the use of location-based data to enrich OOH advertising, and the use of TV data to determine what individuals watch and when they do so to more effectively target consumers with specific ads,” he says. “The programmatic advertising idea is thus enriched and the online world is combined with the ‘real’ world for targeting specific audiences.”
One trend media owners would like to see this year is a more long-term approach from advertisers. They believe the short-termism and demand for a quick return has caused the current clutter which is encouraging ad blocking.
For example, Tim Gentry, global revenue director at Guardian News & Media, says the ad industry must start thinking about building long-term relationships with his readers.
“Part of the solution is offering fewer adverts of higher quality that appear in trusted environments,” he says. “If the industry can collectively adopt this mind-set we can avoid a technical arms race to weave our way around ad blockers which benefits no one.”
This article shows that some of the oldest weapons in a marketers armory, like direct mail, are still sharp enough to cut through any ad-blocker. 
But while ad-blocking is getting all the headlines don’t forget the other challenges like ever declining email open rates, the rise of ‘dark social’, paywalls on social networks reducing organic social to near zero, the trend towards delayed TV watching, Google’s continued assaults on the whole concept of SEO, banner blindness, ever rising paid search and  affiliate which all, individually and combined, make it harder than ever to get marketing messages in front of a target audience.
For those who just can’t see beyond ‘interruption advertising’, the knee-jerk response is simply to shift ad spending to other media more impervious to ad blocking like pre-rolls on You-Tube and Facebook video and mobile newsfeed ads, paid product placement in TV and cinema, and advertorials that increasingly blur the distinction between editorial and ads. 
But we would argue, quoting Steve Ruble of Edelman who said ‘the first solution to ad blocking is to double down on earned media’, that one of the best solutions is ‘positive word of mouth’ where your best customers tell their friends and colleagues just how great your product or service is.
Because when your customer sends a communication to their friend or colleague, it is significantly more likely to be opened and read than any communication sent by your brand. And given that Forrester Research found over 70% of consumers trust brand recommendations from friends, but only 10% trust advertising, this gives you an idea of just how powerful this combination is. 
So in other words, good old fashioned marketing is the best solution to ad-blocking and all these other problems.
If you are still addicted to interruption advertising, you can try the other solutions I mentioned above – but an altogether better solution lies in referral marketing.
I like the idea of “referral marketing” – is there a good primer you can point me to?

The premise of Mark’s article is that digital and interactive are synonymous, and that after ditching the first (correctly) we have ‘replaced’ it with the latter. On both counts, that is not the case. The two words demonstrably mean very different things. Digital is, as Mark quite rightly says, omnipresent. It’s like electricity. Everything that […]

Unilever’s marketers will now have to adopt ‘zero-based budgeting’ – meaning that they will have to justify spending on all new brand activity rather than budgets being based on the previous year’s spend – as the company expands its efficiency drive.
The move comes after Unilever reported better than expected results for 2015, with underlying sales up 4.1% for the full year – although net profits dropped 5% to €5.3bn. Unilever’s CEO Paul Polman warned of “tougher market conditions” in 2016 and said the company is braced for “high volatility”, making cost discipline vital.
Unilever is targeting full-year savings of around €1bn from 2018 by reducing overhead as well as brand and marketing investment. However, zero-based budgeting will apply across the business in order to boost operational efficiencies and comes on top of the €1bn supply chain savings Unilever has already made.
“We are further strengthening our innovation funnel while shortening innovation cycle times, stepping up our digital capabilities and rolling out a global zero based budgeting programme.”
“Our priorities continue to be volume-driven growth ahead of our markets, steady improvements in core operating margin and strong cash flow.”
Unilever has been increasing its marketing spend and it was up again last year by 20 basis points. Speaking on an investor call this morning (19 January), Polman pointed out that brand investment has increased for the past seven years, leading to “brand equities getting stronger and stronger driving therefore the top line growth”.
Much of this increase has come from digital marketing, which accounted for 24% of Unilever’s spend last year. Yet despite the increase Polman said ROI is improving.
“Our return on marketing initiatives have helped bring overheads and brand and marketing efficiency down to conventional benchmark levels. But the benchmarks will continue to improve and so must we,” he commented.
The plan is not to cut marketing spend, but to make it work more efficiently. Polman said spend would remain “at high levels” with a particular focus on its prestige personal care business.
However, Unilever is now focused on getting more bang for its marketing buck by focusing on innovations, bringing new products to market faster and experimenting with new, more personal forms of communication.
“Digital marketing we will be driving to the next level by putting mobile first with an emphasis on engaging effectively with consumers wherever they are,” said Polman.
“By moving from mass marketing to individual marketing through our people data centers and by developing pioneering new models through the Unilever Foundry, like using artificial intelligence for instant and personalised conversations with consumers.”
However, its food spreads business continues to struggle. Unilever rolled it into a separate business unit a year ago in a bid to boost its performance but sales have continued to decline as the entire market contracts in developed countries.
Unilever has also been forced to appoint a new CEO of its food business, with previous head Sean Gogarty stepping down to “pursue other opportunities”.  It announced today (19 January) the division will now be led by Nicolas Liabeuf, formerly Unilever’s SVP of marketing operations.

The digital trends and developments which I believe will shape the industry and digital marketing planning and thinking.
Doug Kessler called this one three years ago with his seminal Crap: the single biggest threat to B2B content marketing.
If we were to plot content marketing on Gartner’s hype cycle then I fear 2016 sees us plunging from the peaks of inflated expectations towards the trough of content marketing disillusionment.
Can marketing take any more contentification? Have we jumped the content shark? Can the world take any more wellness tips from insurance companies?
Like Mr Creosote we are dangerously near tipping over the edge and just one more (wafer thin) piece of content could do it.
Even Twitter can no longer contain the tsunami and its 140 word levee is about to be breached with up to 10,000 characters of content.
And all this with our phones set to ping and ting even more with a wave of notifications.
Just as happened with social media a few years ago, 2016 will see lots of hand-wringing about the ‘ROI of content marketing’.
We will learn to focus on value, quality and relevancy as very few can make volume, quantity and reach work.
2016 will see us thinking more about what we stop doing in content rather than what we start doing.
How to end a post on my 10 digital trends for 2016? By predicting the demise of the listicle perhaps?
Trying to humanise technology is not new. You may remember Microsoft’s paperclip character.
Around five to ten years ago there was also a fashion for putting characters on virtual agents which were typically for customer service and sat on top of an ‘intelligent FAQs’ database.
National Rail has Ask Lisa and has done since 2007.
With the progress in machine learning and AI (artificial intelligence), conversational interfaces, and a flurry of branded bots appearing this trend is back.
The popularity of emojis, and digital stickers, also show the desire to embed more feeling and emotion into digital communications.
In trend four above we saw how the world of pure digital is trying to connect more deeply through physical manifestations.
Similarly, brands, particularly digital services, are now seeking to create more emotive connections by bringing personality to their technology.
We are moving beyond robots that only deal in commands, interactions and transactions.
Technology can detect our emotions (e.g. Emotient, or Google’s Cloud Vision API), robots can detect how we feel (like Pepper) and any self-respecting cool piece of tech has a bot (e.g. Slackbot) and, increasingly, extensible platforms to create your own bots, e.g. Telegram’s Bot Platform or Slack’s Slash Commands.
Ray Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, recently forecast that in 15 years’ time it will be possible to have an emotional relationship with computers.
This was made real in the 2013 film “Her” portraying a man, Theodore Twombly, who falls in love with ‘Samantha,’ an artificially intelligent operating system.
If this seems far-fetched I should point out that I have recently been interacting very naturally and successfully with “Amy Ingram” an AI-powered personal assistant for scheduling meetings.
Amy seems happy to work long hours and even replies at the weekend.
The mixing of human and machine is also evident in the many concierge services springing up. Among them Pana (for travel), Operator and GoButler.
Typically, these services work using part human, part machine learning. The interesting one to watch here of course is Facebook M.
Pure human assistance is very useful but not very scalable. Pure machine is very scalable but not always very useful. M’s challenge, and services like it, is to be both.
What does this all mean for marketers? It creates all sorts of exciting opportunities to create more intelligent services and ones which, though digital, really resonate with the brand and have personality.
In a few years I expect we will find it odd not to be able to message a brand and have a conversation which we will expect to be bot-powered to start with.
Some of us may even prefer to interact with branded bots rather than humans.
The challenge for us, as marketers, will be how to imbue these robobrands with the right brand sentience.
It will mean great copywriting is once more highly prised and interfaces will become more verbal. Getting the right tone and the right attitude will be hard but those that do will win.
We all know that the fabled ‘year of mobile’ was about a decade ago.
In the last two years most of us have finally got round to mobile-optimising our websites and emails typically using responsive design.
However, what slightly surprises me is that for many marketers I get the sense they think that means they have ticked the mobile box, mobile is covered, mobile is mostly ‘done’.
Mobile (and the same is true of video and even social) tends not to appear on the hot topics or buzzwords list.
Which is odd given we surely recognise that mobile is eating the world?
So I have put mobile in as a trend largely as a collective slap in the face to remind ourselves just how big a thing this still is.
Remember:
Really we shouldn’t be asking ourselves what our mobile strategy is anymore. We should be wondering what our desktop strategy is given most of what our customers do is mobile?
So if you think you are mostly done with mobile then think again.
Some mobile questions that should be on your mind for 2016:
In short: for the foreseeable future every year should be the year of mobile.
One of my three digital marketing mega trends for 2015 was the return of creativity and design. Then I focused on creativity.
This year I want to highlight design. More specifically, digital product/service design.
It is always helpful with trends to look at the jobs market and see which roles and expertise are most in demand.
Great developers are still gold dust but in the last six months or so the question I keep hearing is ‘does anyone know a great (digital) designer’?
That special person who not only gets the big idea, the brand, the look and feel, but can also do information architecture, gets UX and UI, appreciates the customer journey, obviously knows responsive inside out, is current with this morning’s latest trends in iOS vs Android transition effects, and is working on conversational interfaces in his/her spare time.
And, like good childcare or a great plumber, if you do know this person you sure as hell are not giving their details to anyone else.
Speaking to a few agency Creative Directors recently they admitted they were starting to feel out of touch with aspects of their craft.
In particular, prototyping and app design/concepts. Talk to startups and product managers/designers and you will hear about Sketch, Invision, Marvel and the like.
The corporate world is catching up. Indeed Adobe’s imminent launch of Comet must be its response to this need.
Expect a lot of activity in this area, both tech, talent and techniques, over 2016.
Also indicative of underlying trends is what is happening in mergers and acquisitions. Here are some headlines that tell a story around the ascendance of design:
You get the idea…
All the major consultancies, both management and strategy, as well as the systems integrators are investing considerably in design services.
Indian outsourcing companies recognise they need to beef up their design credentials and I expect we will see Chinese businesses buying their way into this space too.
Let us not forget that IBM Interactive Experience last year announced a $100m investment to expand its interactive design business, acquiring talent and opening interactive experience labs and studios around the world.
Indeed even in 2014 IBM Interactive Experience was named the largest global digital agency by AdAge and in 2015 IBM IX came second only to Sapient in Econsultancy’s Top 100 Digital Agencies.
Perhaps the most interesting acquisition in this area was at the end of 2014 because it was a major financial services brand buying a leading product design consultancy: Capital One acquired Adaptive Path.
In 2016 it would not be surprising to see more brands make design acquisitions or acqui-hires.
At the very least expect to see design and product people become part of senior leadership teams e.g. Mike Bracken’s hiring of his former Government Digital Services’ colleagues to The Co-Op Digital Service includes a Digital Services Director and Group Design Director to help lead the Co-Op’s digital transformation.
Finally, whilst the big tech companies may have been focusing on data and digital marketing platforms and services to date, expect to see much more focus on design this year e.g. with Adobe’s launch of Comet and Google (behind Material Design of course) set to further empower designers with Google Web Designer.
While Econsultancy cannot quite claim to have coined the term ‘digital transformation’ (I would probably give that accolade to Cap Gemini), we certainly helped popularise the term.
My presentation on Slideshare on Digital Transformation from 2013 attempted to define the term at the time.
Certainly we have been researching, writing about, consulting on, and helping deliver digital transformation for longer than most.
I describe digital transformation simply as the journey towards being a digital organisation where “digital” means two things: firstly, focusing on the customer experience irrespective of channel, and secondly, having a digital culture.
I believe the seven defining characteristics of a digital culture are:
As part of this transformation journey most organisations follow a similar evolution of organisational structure.
Full details of this are given in Econsultancy’s recently updated Digital Marketing: Organisational Structures and Resourcing Best Practice Guide.
The graphic below outlines a typical five stage evolution towards true multi-channel customer-centricity. Each stage has a typical corresponding job title and organisational structure for digital.
My observation for 2016 is that most businesses are somewhere between stages two and four. We are entering the teenage years for digital transformation.
These are years of change, of experimentation, of pain, of growth, of tumult, of crises of self-identity, of commotion and instability.
We have already seen in my trends two and five above how the agency and consultancy worlds are colliding and blurring.
Apparently pretty much everyone these days offers ‘digital transformation’ services of some sort.
On the client side we will continue to see re-organisations, new job titles like Chief Digital Officer or Chief Customer Officer, new joint ventures, labs, innovation centres, start-up partnerships, accelerators and acquisitions in an attempt to kick start or accelerate their transformations.
2015 saw a number of examples of brands buying, or investing in, digital agencies and talent: Jaguar created a joint venture with agency Spark 44 to manage its global communications; Coty bought content agency Beamly; Unilever has its Foundry; Visa set up Europe Collab; Barclays has its Accelerator; the list goes on.
In the early years of digital transformation most businesses had digital in a silo.
This created obvious problems so the broad consensus was that actually digital needed to be embedded throughout the core business.
So the last years have seen efforts to ‘digitize’ the mothership and make digital part of the operating model and DNA of the whole business. It turns out this is not very easy either and has all sorts of challenges too: the biggest of which is a lack of speed.
One possible approach to address this problem, promoted by McKinsey, is a two-speed operating model for accelerating digital transformation.
Either this is somewhat of a bodge to avoid driving through difficult but necessary change, or it is a smart and realistic way to get where you want faster without dangerous levels of disruption.
Whichever it is, expect to see more struggles, at varying speeds, with digital transformation this year.
The early days of digital marketing were all about push marketing.
Display advertising, of course, but email lists were a big thing. Lists you built yourself or lists you bought. And then hammered away at.
Then we shifted to more of a pull paradigm. ‘Inbound marketing’ is very much pull not push.
SEO in its more mature form is pull, content marketing is more pull than push, social likewise.
But I think we are seeing a shift back towards more of a push architecture. In a small way this is just desperation around those who have spent money on content and mobile apps, find they are not getting much traction, so resort to more push advertising.
But more fundamentally this about messaging, notifications and more context-aware services.
Already the notification screen is the primary interface for mobile. All the big players (Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon etc.) are rapidly developing services that are ‘smart’ and assistive.
Whether the slew of personal assistant type applications (Siri, Google Now, Cortana, Facebook M etc.) or sensor-driven smart services (Amazon Dash, Google Nest etc.) or simply the sky-rocketing usage of messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat and the resulting ‘tings’ on our phone craving our attention.
The evolution I believe we are in goes something like this:
‘Context’ has a lot of possible dimensions: behaviour, location, the weather, what is happening in the world, the time of day, device, pretty much anything.
Because of mobile, and the growth in location intelligence (iBeacons being just one example but the likes of Estimote are doing interesting things), it is likely that user behaviour and location will be the most common forms of ‘context’ to be used in our marketing and customer experience thinking this year.
The best articulation of this shift I have read is Fjord’s concept of ‘Living Services’ where they not only talk about new interaction paradigms like gesture, voice and touch but how we need to consider how environments and context are changing more than how industry sectors are changing.
We need to build aware platforms where the customer is the operating system we plug into.
For example, this case study from Telefonica Research shows how it is possible to tell how bored someone is from their mobile activity with an 83% accuracy rate.
In this test the bored participants were sent notifications recommending content on Buzzfeed and were much more likely to respond than the non-bored segment.
So we are witnessing behaviour whereby a prod (i.e. push), mostly in the form of a notification, is required to get attention.
But that interface (now mostly via the lock screen on your phone) is controlled by the mobile operating systems and who knows how they will choose to prioritise what the user gets and how those notifications will be prioritised in the future.
And with predictive and assistive services it may be we will not expect to “go” to anything on our phones – it will come to us.
The big question for us as marketers then is how on earth do we fit in? And how will we make sure our notifications are seen and heard amidst the torrent of others?
As we re-enter an era of push, albeit ‘smart push’, we will need to re-learn the lessons from email marketing about permission, relevance, context and personalisation.
The blending of digital and physical is not a new trend but it is one that will continue to be front of mind throughout 2016 and beyond.
Last year we saw a lot of interesting developments from the big ‘digital’ players in the physical world: Amazon opened a bookshop and turned domestic appliances into a retail channel via its Dash Buttons; Google opened its first store in London.
There was some impressive innovation around digital/physical from major brands too. Highlights for me included:
This year we will see further innovation, for example more programmatically driven digital out-of-home media.
Where it gets really interesting is when digital is used to create the physical. The opportunities around 3D printing are very exciting here of course.
Eyewear business Warby Parker already provide a mobile app called Bookmark that allows customers to see a photo of themselves and buy the glasses, but CEO Neil Blumenthal envisages “…that in the very near future you’ll be able to get your glasses prescription through your mobile device” and, who knows, perhaps you will be able to print them out at home too?
From a brand point of view it is interesting to see how digital is seeking out further depth and substance through a physical connection and manifestation.
Evernote has partnered with Moleskine to create Evernote books for example.
3M’s Post-it notes, quintessentially physical, were given a quasi-physical manifestation as reborn retargeted banner ads.
Could this bastard lovechild of marketing and architecture become a buzzword for 2016?
Even if not I would at least expect to hear much more talk about ‘martech’ and challenges around architecting your martech stack. Move over ad tech, martech has arrived.
Why is this?
In the preceding years we have been busy collecting data, buying technology, trying to integrate systems, launching new channels (particularly social and mobile) and trying to deliver increasingly personalised customer experiences against a background of increasing complexity and fragmentation.
It is hard. It is a bit of a mess. We are worried the whole thing might fall over at some point.
No-one is quite sure of all the triggers, rules, tags and automation in place.
Some questions for you:
These are hard questions. But they are not going away and they will become more frequently asked in 2016.
There is a great interview with BCG’s Philip Evans on ‘stacks’ and ‘architecture’ as business concepts. There are clear parallels with marketing.
Shearing layers was a concept coined by architect Frank Duffy, then elaborated by Stewart Brand in his book “How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They’re Built”, and refers to buildings as composed of several layers of change.
This concept has already been adapted to tech system architecture by the likes of Gartner, but also makes a lot of sense as a framework for architecting marketing ecosystems that can deal with the level of change we are experiencing.
There are even greater parallels between marketing and engineering as the worlds of digital, data, technology and marketing collide.
We have no shortage of data but we now need to create rules and logic, a form of marketing middleware, to drive all forms of marketing automation. And this is essentially programming.
Not just programmatic media but programmatic marketing more generally.
Start-up marketers (aka ‘growth marketers’) are already used to the likes of IFTTT and Zapier to wire up their marketing tech. Marketing ops have a lot to learn from dev ops.
The rise in the strategic importance, and difficulty, of all this is why even strategy consultancies like McKinsey are growing their marketing ops practice and why it bought Agiliti just over a year ago.
Expect more M&A in the agency and consulting worlds around ‘marchitecture’.
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more complex…
In the graphic below on the left is a classic marketing funnel. In the middle, at the top, you can see the famous LUMAscape graphic showing the complexity of the vendors in the display ad tech space.
These typically cover the top half of the marketing funnel.
In the middle, covering the bottom half of the funnel, is Scott Brinker’s Marketing Technology landscape graphic which is equally busy.
To the right are the service businesses (agencies and consultancies) with a crude split showing the (mostly media) agencies servicing the top of the funnel and the SIs and consultancies servicing the bottom half.
Agencies tend to talk about DMPs (Data Management Platforms) whilst the back end centres more around CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platforms.
My observation, and trend, is not only how complex this all is and how it needs some brains to properly architect it all (see previous trend) but that these two “halves” of the funnel, historically quite distinct, are fast merging into a single view of the customer journey where there is data visibility, tracking and tech inter-operation throughout the funnel.
The big resulting question is who should be in charge and which system, or what data, should drive the other?
Do you dump your media agency and give it all to a management consultancy who is good with business/CRM data and can use programmatic platforms to drive the top of the funnel?
Or do you open up your back office data to your media agency and target them on metrics like sales and margin rather than more traditional media metrics?
This is the war that is raging in agency-consultancy land.
WPP bought Acceleration and Essence, among others, to bolster its data-throughout-the-funnel capabilities (note GroupM’s Gotlieb: ‘Media Needs To Morph From The Top Of The Funnel To The Transaction’) whilst all the big consultancies (Accenture Digital, IBM Interactive Experience, Deloitte Digital, PWC Digital, McKinsey, BCG, Cap Gemini, Tata etc.) are rapidly encroaching on traditionally agency space.
And in techland DMPs and CRMs are the front lines of the/martech tussle.
Oracle’s acquisition of BlueKai, a leading DMP, connecting it natively into its marketing cloud, is one example of the bottom of the funnel swallowing the top half.
Expect more marketing cloud companies to assimilate DMP and CRM offerings this year.
So who will win these battles?
Obviously there is no simple answer. But certainly the once-so-sexy world of media and advertising at the top of the funnel is looking seriously threatened by its historically less glamorous below-the-line cousin.
Argos’ case study in joining up real-time advertising through the customer funnel is one of an increasing number of brands using CRM data to drive top-of-the-funnel advertising and media in real-time.
The idea of ‘streaming CRM’ will become more commonplace: read about streaming CRM in the context of travel here and note Sociomantic is owned by dunnhumby, in turn owned by Tesco, both companies known much more for transactional data than media.
Recent Marketing Week articles include “How CRM is becoming the ‘new advertising” and “Why CMOs are shifting their focus from customer acquisition to retention” backed with data and trends to support a view that the bottom of the funnel might usurp the top rather than the other way round.
Wow! Thanks for the very extensive list here! I appreciate the work that went into this.
One-to-one communications are increasingly replacing above-the-line campaigns.
CMOs are shifting their focus and budgets from acquiring new customers to keeping them engaged throughout the customer journey, according to a new study.
With Coty acquiring social content agency Beamly as it gears up to buy beauty brands from P&G, agencies must keep up with client demands in order to survive.
An influx of negative news focusing on sugar, trans fats and misleading food labels has led to a distrust of brands and change in consumer buying behaviour, new research shows.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

From campaigns that sung on social media to ads that helped save lives, Marketing Week takes a look at the top ads of 2015.
Coca-Cola radically changed the way it markets its products, introducing a “one brand strategy” where its four product variants – Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero and Coca-Cola Life – fit underneath the master brand rather than being supported with separate campaigns.
The move saw the company evolve its “Open Happiness” strapline to “Choose Happiness” in Great Britain in an bid to help consumers make informed choices and suggest there is a Coca-Cola to suit every taste by more clearly communicating product differentiation.
It was part of an effort to grow sales in the company’s flagship European market, Great Britain, as well as boost sales of its lower and no calorie variants. Research conducted by the brand found that half of consumers did not know that Coke Zero has no sugar and no calories and were unclear about the difference between Coke Zero and Diet Coke.
The new strategy has been used across its TV advertising, as well as in its sponsorship of the Rugby World Cup.
Initial sales figures suggest the shift has paid off. Data from IRI shows that total Coca-Cola value sales across its variants were up in the UK by 1.46% year on year to £480.3m for the 20 weeks to 18 July (the period during which the strategy has been in place). Meanwhile, main rival Pepsi saw total sales drop 8.4% to £161.7m.
However, proof of success will not be known for at least a year, when it will be clearer if Coca-Cola has managed to sustain those sales.
Coca-Cola has also had a tougher time improving consumer perceptions of its brand. This is in part down to growing public health concerns over sugar, with a group of MPs recently recommending the introduction of a sugar tax, an idea that brands such as Jamie Oliver and Leon have already implemented.
According to YouGov’s BrandIndex, Coca-Cola’s reputation score has fallen by a statistically significant 8.9 points over the past six months. However the wider carbonated drinks market has also seen a decline.
During SXSW festival in Austin this year, various male Tinder users couldn’t believe their luck when they were matched with a beautiful brunette called “Ava” who claimed to be in the nearby area looking for love.
She did, however, ask them a variety of unusual questions, including: “Have you ever been in love?” and “What makes you human”. After carrying on the conversation, Ava revealed her true identity by sending a link to her Instagram page where the users would discover that she is actually a robot and they have been the victims of a marketing stunt to promote artificial intelligence thriller Ex Machina.
And people weren’t best pleased. Most of the reactions to the campaign have been negative, with many characterising the approach as “counter-productive”, “an invasion of privacy”, “trolling” and “trickery”.
However, Marketing Week’s own columnist Mark Ritson was much more positive about it, saying the campaign “ticks all the boxes for what great tactical work should achieve”.
Kit Kat was facing a tough fight – figures from Euromonitor show that sales fell 10.3% across the entire chocolate snacking category between 2010 and 2015, and is predicted to decline further over the next five years by 9.6%. Kit Kat faced the challenge of trying to increase sales in a declining market.
To do that, it decided to double its marketing spend this year to £10m and launched its “Celebrate the breaks” campaign to grab people’s attention.
It started by undertaking its biggest wrapper redesign since the brand came to market almost 80 years ago, changing the logo on more than 100 million packets to reflect the different ways consumers spend their breaks – including one with “YouTube my break” branding.
It then went on to release various “moment marketing” campaigns in collaboration with J. Walter Thompson, which saw the brand push out topical and humourous adverts relating to events such as the new James Bond film, Black Friday and Christmas.
And this hasn’t been without success – according to IRI data, total Kit Kat sales were £194.0m in the 52 weeks ending 7 November 2015, compared to £186.7m in the previous year, marking an increase of 3.9%.
Most people associate toothpaste adverts with white-toothed models who are overly excited to be brushing their teeth. However, Listerine went down a different route and shook up the oral care market with a “heartwarming and thought provoking” campaign that aims to bring the power of a smile to blind people.
In September the brand launched an app designed to let blind people know when someone is smiling at them. Built by its creative agency J. Walter Thompson, the app uses facial recognition and a phone’s camera to detect a smile from up to five metres away and notifies the app user with a vibration or a beep.
The app was promoted by a short film “Feel Every Smile”, which stars four blind people talking about what smiles mean to them.
Listerine’s brand director Alice Lovell said the brand is looking to move away from the “white smile idea” so prevalent in oral care to focus more on what a smile means and its impact on those around you. The video was a huge success, gaining over 2 million views since its launch.
Ready for some controversy? Few people had heard of Protein World before they placed bright yellow posters throughout the London Underground in April this year. However, this soon changed.
The ad, which promoted the brand’s slimming product and featured a woman wearing a bikini, received 378 ASA complaints after appearing throughout the London Underground, while a Change.org petition calling for the ad to be removed received over 40,000 signatures. Commuters also defaced many of the ads and took to social media with the hash tag #EachBodysReady to express their anger.
After an investigation into the complaints, the ASA decided that the campaign was not in breach, concluding “the headline and image were unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence.” However, the body did ban the ad due to concerns over “health and weight loss claims made in the ad”.
In response to negative tweets about the campaign, Protein World CEO Arjun Seth wrote that “sales have tripled and the PR department just got their bonus” while the brand has defiantly re-tweeted numerous offensive tweets about its body image. Marketing Week’s very own Mark Ritson also waded in to the debate, branding the ads and the furore surrounding them “great marketing”.
While Sainsbury’s decided to pull on people’s heartstrings with last year’s World War 1 Christmas ad, this year the retailer decided to do the opposite.
In November it launched a whimsical campaign in collaboration with AMV BBDO, featuring a CGI version of author Judith Kerr’s fictional feline character Mog. It sees the cat accidentally ruining Christmas by setting fire to his family’s house. However, the fire service and neighbours come to the rescue with food and presents alongside the returning Sainsbury’s ‘Christmas is for Sharing’ slogan.
Much like last year, the campaign features a tie-up with a charity. Throughout the festive season, Sainsbury’s will sell a new storybook of Kerr’s Mog in its stores with all sales donated to Save The Children.
While it’s early days to see how the campaign has impacted the supermarket’s sales, YouGov BrandIndex figures show that the ‘buzz’ around the brand has seen its score increase by 5.1 points over the past month, placing it fourth out of a list of 26 supermarket brands. The brand’s purchase consideration increased significantly by 4.2 points to a score of 47 after the ad launched in November.
Meanwhile, a study by Waggener Edstrom assessing the social media impact of each retailer’s Christmas marketing over the last four weeks showed that Sainsbury’s ad made the second-biggest impact on social media.
Sport England’s ‘This Girl Can’ campaign hit the airwaves in January this year, showing real women exercising. The campaign was born out of insight which showed that 75% of women say they would like to exercise more, but refrain from doing so due to a fear of judgement.
Speaking about the campaign earlier this year at Advertising Week Europe, Sport England’s director of business partnerships Tanya Joseph said: “We needed to do something radical and disruptive, as most female sport advertising is incredibly stylised and airbrushed”. It clearly captured a nerve, as 13 million people have now viewed the This Girl Can film online.
The campaign, which was created by FCB Inferno, has also gained industry-wide recognition, winning nine Cannes Lions and Joseph being named ‘Marketer of the year’ at this year’s Masters of Marketing awards.
To push the campaign even further, Sport England teamed up with retailer M&S for an exclusive range of t-shirts and also launched a new app to encourage women to post viral sporting videos.
St. John Ambulance decided to take action after its research showed that 79% of parents did not know how to help a choking baby, despite 58% saying it was a major concern.
The result was ‘The Chokeables’ – a 40-second ad that demonstrates how to save a choking baby, featuring the celebrity voices of David Mitchell, David Walliams, Johnny Vegas and Sir John Hurt.
The ad, which was created by BBH and aired across several television channels, has racked up millions of views across YouTube and Twitter. Estimates by the company indicate that 20.9 million people saw it in its first week on television, while the video has also been shared over 155,000 times on St. John Ambulance’s Facebook page.
But the ad also produced some real-life results – stories have been sent to the charity about 42 babies and children who have choked on a variety of objects and were saved by the ad as a result. In each instance, the person who leapt into action said that they’d learned the technique from The Chokeables video.
This year, car manufacturer Volvo revealed a new ambition: that by 2020 no-one will be killed or seriously injured in road accidents.
To help it achieve that the brand looked not at ways of making its car safer, but how to avoid crashes altogether. It identified cyclists as some of those most at risk and began investigating how to make travel safer for them.
Created in collaboration with Grey London, the brand brought out ‘LifePaint’ – a reflective safety spray aimed at increasing the visibility and safety of cyclists and other road users. While it is invisible by daylight, it glows brightly in the glare of car headlights.
LifePaint launched on a total budget of £65,000 and generated global media attention, 5.9m organic YouTube views and worldwide demand for the product.
Following the huge success of the initial trial the product is now an official Volvo spare part, which means any Volvo dealership in the world can order the product for retail to sell at the cost price of £10. Volvo makes no profit on the sale of LifePaint.
The product is also publicly available in locations such as cycle shops in the UK, Canada, Austria, The Netherlands and New Zealand, with more countries to follow in 2016.
Bakery brand Warburtons is a company that prides itself on its heritage. It’s a fifth-generation family business that is run today by cousins Jonathan, Brett and Ross Warburton, and has used its family identity in advertising on and off throughout its 139-year history.
However, the company decided to step things up a notch by launching its biggest ever campaign. Created by WCRS and costing £16m, it featured Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone and the tagline ‘From our family to yours’.
“All our advertising at the moment also features our chairman Jonathan [Warburton], which helps us move away from being a faceless corporation and shows consumers the real people behind the business,” marketing manager Sally Stanton told Marketing Week at the time.
It is a strategy that appears to be paying off, the brand is the biggest bakery business in the country by sales and the second largest grocery brand overall after Coca-Cola, having doubled its turnover between 2001 and 2011.
Kantar Worldpanel says it is the most frequently purchased grocery product in the UK, chosen on average 25 times a year by 86% of households.
It followed up the Stallone campaign with an even bigger £25m featuring The Muppets.
Ahead of International Women’s Day on 8 March, Women’s Aid installed a billboard designed to grab and keep hold of the attention of passersby.
The billboard creative, by WCRS, used facial recognition technology to recognise when people actively paid attention to the image of a bruised woman. As more people take notice of the image of the women, her bruises slowly heal, demonstrating to viewers that by taking notice they can help confront the signs of domestic violence by not turning a blind eye.
People were also encouraged to donate £5 to Women’s Aid, the charity behind the campaign, to stop domestic abuse.
‘Look at Me’ was the first of its kind to use eye-recognition to trigger an immediate change in an outdoor poster’s creative message, and won a Gold Cannes Lions Award in June this year.
It also won an award for best ‘Outdoor and location-based marketing’ campaign at this year’s Masters of Marketing awards, with one of the judges stating that “it used a fantastic blend of technology and outdoor media to drive awareness that clearly answered the needs of the cause”.
It would be fair to say that the emoji language has had a breakthrough 12 months, with the Oxford English Dictionairy even naming the ‘tears of joy’ emoji as ‘word’ of the year. But 2015 also saw various brands incorporate the popular characters in their campaigns.
In May, The World Wildlife Fund ran a Twitter campaign using emojis to tell the story of endangered species and encouraged people to donate via the social network.
The campaign, created by Wieden+Kennedy, was sparked by the discovery that 17 characters in the emoji alphabet represent endangered species.
Meanwhile, Ikea launched a catalogue of branded emojis, through which the retailer hopes to improve communication around the home by helping to keep the conversation “light and friendly”. It seems that emojis are becoming marketers’ go-to global language.

From Uber accepting it needs marketing to better tell its story to brands such as L’Oreal and Philips looking to the ‘internet of things’ to create tighter bonds with consumers, Marketing Week presents a round-up of the key talking points from Dreamforce 2015.
Dreamforce kicked off with the launch of Salesforce’s next generation CRM platform SalesforceIQ and a declaration from the company that “we’re moving from a world of relationship management, to a world of relationship intelligence”. In practice this means CRM is becoming increasingly automated, with data processing technology now able to provide brands with recommended actions based on predictions of future customer behaviour.
“When you log in [to the system] in the morning, you’re no longer just reacting to what’s on the dashboard and trying to figure out what to do next,” said Steve Loughlin, CEO of SalesforceIQ. “The system is actually intelligently suggesting what you should do.”
Of course no single platform will be a panacea for the CRM needs of any one brand. Various companies at Dreamforce, though, spoke about how they are using predictive technology to improve the level of automation and intelligence within their internal CRM systems.
Ticketmaster International, for example, which manages ticketing websites in 16 global markets, is using advanced data science technology and machine learning to match its owned data with real-time factors that are likely to influence people’s purchasing behaviour.
Speaking to Marketing Week, its VP of insight and marketing Sophie Crosby said her main ambition for the company over the next two years is for it to become “more relevant, more personalised and much more customer-centric” in its direct communications with consumers.
“We’ve got huge amounts of insight on [customers’] genre affinity –  whether it’s thrash metal music or whatever – where they live and their distance from the venue, what they’ve been clicking on our website,” she asserted.
“But true marketing automation, true one-to-one communication, is bringing all that together into a proper recommendations engine and being able to deliver out that tailored communication at scale. That requires lots of different parts to be very well lined up to work together. It’s a very big project for us.”
Similarly Field Nation, a US website for connecting businesses with freelance contractors, said it is using the latest technology to create predictive, intuitive algorithms within its CRM. These are enabling the company to target its marketing communications more effectively in real time, claimed chief marketing officer Billy Cripe.
“Last year we were just starting to dip our toe into building some heuristics for scoring demand, based on readiness to hand off leads to [the] sales [department],” he said.
“Over the course of the last year we’ve been able to radically refine and update those by being smarter with the data that we capture and by doing continuous experimentation on what works and what doesn’t. We see that as a never-ending process and it’s one of the reasons we hired a data scientist – to find out those predictors.”
Salesforce’s other big announcement this week, its launch of Salesforce IoT Cloud, a platform for gathering insights and coordinating marketing across connected devices – also set the tone for much of the discussion at Dreamforce as brands pondered the potential of the much-trumpeted internet of things.
However Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sounded a note of caution in his keynote address by arguing that companies should always think in terms of customer experiences, rather than specific devices.
“Computing is going to be everywhere, so the question is are experiences going to move around as people move around?”
Nadella claimed that Windows 10, the new Microsoft operating system that launched in July, “is built for mobility of experience”, with Microsoft’s expanding cloud capacity and its use of machine learning enabling the company to respond with increasing intelligence to people’s needs.
He also revealed more details of Microsoft HoloLens: a wearable computer that seeks to make high-definition holograms appear seamlessly in the physical world.
Microsoft describes the technology as “mixed reality” and claims it will “unlock all-new ways to create, communicate, work and play”. Nadella said that Microsoft would launch a developers’ kit for HoloLens by next year, but added it would be “a five-year journey” before the technology comes to full fruition.
Meanwhile Christophe Eymery, head of digital and media at L’Oréal ANZ, confirmed that his company is actively exploring its role within the internet of things. That includes the possibility of a smartwatch app that would use sensors to gather data on the user’s skin type and the level of humidity in the air in order to provide the wearer with recommendations about the best creams or products to buy.
He added, though, that this is a “dreamland” concept at present, with no plans currently in place for L’Oreal to make it a reality. Instead Eymery explained how L’Oreal is using social media channels and its mobile app, Makeup Genius, to engage consumers with exclusive content and to turn shoppers in the physical world into digital fans who are more inclined to share their data with the company.
Makeup Genius, which launched last year, incorporates augmented reality technology that enables users to see how different products would look on their face, as well as content about the make-up worn by celebrities that consumers can then click through to buy. The app currently has 30 million downloads globally and a click-to-buy conversion rate of 2-4%, Eymery said.
“We are evolving from being a product-oriented company to more of a service-oriented organisation,” he declared.
There were numerous instances at this year’s Dreamforce of brands that are using heightened levels of digital connectivity to extend their role in people’s lives.
Electronics group Philips, for example, explained that its healthcare division is growing quickly as a consequence of its connected healthcare appliances and its cloud-based platform for healthcare professionals. The company demonstrated everyday items like connected toothbrushes, but also more specialist items like a connected blood glucose reader for diabetes patients.
“What you’re seeing is that our healthcare and consumer lifestyle businesses are merging together – and that’s deliberate,” Hans Notenboom, global head of digital at Philips Healthcare, told Marketing Week.
“We believe that as we face the enormous challenges that we have in healthcare, there’s a big opportunity to bring together the personal health space and the professional healthcare world.”
Notenboom suggested that one possibility for the future could be for people to use its connected cooker device – part of its consumer lifestyle business – to simultaneously manage their diet and support their health goals online. This merging of functions could serve to deepen people’s level of affinity for the Philips brand and its role in their lives.
“We don’t have all the answers right now, but there’s a big opportunity in bringing those two worlds together,” he added.
Similarly OnStar, the connected car division of General Motors (GM), is using new technology to expand its presence in people’s lives.
OnStar was founded as an in-vehicle security and safety system, but has since grown to incorporate all aspects of GM’s connected car business. It runs on 4G LTE technology and is available across GM’s brands, which include Chevrolet, Buick and Vauxhall.
Next month the company is launching At Your Service, a new section within the OnStar mobile app in which users are served location-based coupons and offers from retailers according to their driving behaviour, such as places that they commonly visit.
Rick Ruskin, marketing and product manager for OnStar, explained that the initiative is part of an effort to make technology a seamless part of people’s everyday routines.
“When ‘At You Service’ loads next month we expect to see a huge spike [in usage],” he said. “People love the fact that we’re giving them a bit more value and daily relevance to how OnStar can help them in their lives.”
The brand causing the biggest stir at Dreamforce was Uber: the highly disruptive and somewhat controversial car-hailing service. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff put it quite succinctly when he noted during an on-stage ‘fireside chat’ with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick that the company “is literally changing the world” with its sharing economy business model.
Uber was out in force at the conference too, running demonstrations of its expanding B2B service Uber for Business and the app’s new car-pooling feature UberPool. Yet this was ostensibly a PR offensive by Uber first and foremost as it seeks to boost its brand reputation following a stream of negative stories over the last year.
Kalanick pointed out that attacks against Uber are in part an inevitable consequence of its disruptive impact on the global taxi industry. He acknowledged too, though, that as a result of its rapid growth, the company needs to better articulate its brand values and tell its own story.
In other words being disruptive only goes so far: once a brand reaches a certain size, it becomes the dominant player itself, subject to widespread challenges from smaller rivals.
Kalanick even noted that the advent of the driverless car and artificial intelligence in the coming decades could undermine Uber’s own business model. But he argued that the company must embrace change, rather than row against it.
“As a tech company you always have to say that you want to be a part of the future,” he said.
When expertly executed, gamified content heightens audience engagement. And with the industry predicted to grow to a value of £1.8bn by the end of 2016, JBH’s Jane Hunt says nothing beats a high-quality concept paired with a user-friendly, immersive experience.
Even in this digital age, 60% of UK journalists prefer traditional press releases over other news mediums. Vuelio’s Priyanka Dayal sets out a step-by-step guide on understanding the key points every press release must address and the channels they must depend on for success.
Pinterest has worked with TopShop to help it better integrate the online and offline customer experience as it deepens its relationship with brands and gives them more reasons to use the site.
The deadline for entering the The Masters of Marketing awards is approaching fast (September 23) and therefore I thought I’d take a look at one of the most complex and somewhat overlooked categories: Performance Marketing.

From delivering flowers to booking travel, Facebook is taking on Apple’s Siri by introducing its very own personal assistant feature on Facebook Messenger. But how could brands benefit?
A month after revealing plans to monetise its messenger app, Facebook has introduced “M”.
The feature is aimed at making customers’ lives easier, with “M” being able to complete tasks like buy items, deliver gifts and book travel tickets.
Perhaps the most unique aspect is that “M” isn’t supported by artificial intelligence. Facebook is employing real people to help answer people’s requests, with plans to teach the technology how to handle them automatically in future.
While the feature is still in early beta-testing, “M” could represent a huge opportunity for brands who are willing to take a punt.
“Imagine being able to serve highly targeted ads that launch directly into an intelligent interface to deliver your product. Sounds brilliant, although you can be sure Facebook will take a cut,” Daniel Price, head of social operations at social and content agency Lost Boys says.
The service also provides brands with the ability to deliver the right message at the right time, adds digital agency Connect’s client partner José Espinosa.
“By giving brands the ability to serve their message at certain trigger points, it ensures that it is something the consumer is interested in and delivered at the moment of truth,” he says.
“Ultimately, ‘M’ could follow a similar path to Google, which moved from a simple search tool to an integral part of a person’s online lifestyle.”
The service also offers real opportunities for brands to deepen their relationship with consumers, says digital marketing agency Barracuda director Martin Dinham.
“Imagine a dry cleaning service that provides information on its nearest branch via the assistant, but then also offers physical collection and drop off at the user’s home address via a workforce,” he says.
But privacy concerns could potentially pose a problem with consumers.
“Messenger is already a controversial product – after it was separated from the main Facebook product there was a large privacy backlash,” adds Price.
But while the feature might give Facebook further data about individuals’ personal habits, Dinham isn’t too worried.
“History shows that consumers are often willing to give this up in exchange for convenience. If I were Google or Apple, I’d be watching this with great interest.”
But the app won’t be useful for everyone, predicts social media company Agency:2’s founder and director Joel Davis.
“Not all brands will be able to profit from the messenger’s new feature, judging by how likely people are to change habits.”
“If the app is going to provide more customer support, the value is going to be in the more complicated purchasing journeys where people will want a helping hand.
“Travel in particular could benefit from this service – it’ll be interesting to see how it develops.”
First mover advantage is essential, adds TH_NK experience director Lee Allen.
“As brand visibility begins to evaporate on mobile devices in favour of these all-encompassing services like Facebook’s M, you’ll want to be the first brand that delivers your service within that context,” he says.
David Tapp, head of digital at The Organic Agency believes that brand awareness and Facebook page performance might also become more important.
“As we are expecting ‘M’ to act as a helper mid chat, there will be times when ‘M’ will want to suggest places to buy a certain product – and Facebook will most likely want to use their own data to do this,” he says.
“This means that the overall brand noise on Facebook could play a part, but it will mostly be a brand’s organic reach, engagement and even paid activity when it comes to getting your shop as a preferred option in ‘M’ suggestions.”
But if Facebook does go down the route of paid recommendations, it must be careful not to lose its legitimacy, adds We Are Social marketing director Tom Ollerton.
“I imagine there will be sponsorship opportunities for certain categories or locations, but Facebook will need to be careful not to lose the authenticity of any recommendations,” he says.
“If successful, it will also act as yet another data collection service, allowing Facebook to learn even more about its community’s needs and wants, and lead to even tighter ad targeting opportunities.”
As Facebook takes a gamble, it might be best for brands to wait and see.
Marketers believe that Facebook is the best performing social ad platform, leaving other social sites trailing behind, according to a new report by research house Forrester
Even though 75% of all online content in the UK is being shared through dark channels – areas not measured by web analytics such as links sent via email, online forums or private instant messenger platforms such as WhatsApp – brands are still “overwhelmingly” neglecting the space, according to new research from RadiumOne.
Messenger now has 700 million users while WhatsApp has 300 million but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says while the plan is to monetise those services any meaningful revenue is still some way off.
His first year was about stability, his second should be about rekindling brand love.

The future of personalisation could involve a digital personal shopping assistant to “help users through the fragmented customer journey” according to Google’s vp of product management Jonathan Alferness.
Speaking with Marketing Week at the Think With Google event in London today (7 July), Alferness said the customer journey has become increasingly fragmented, adding that “the online existence is shifting from one where folks would sit down and spend all of this concentrated time online in one chunk to essentially those micro moments of time throughout the day that add up in reality to even more time than we were spending online before”.
He said the tech giant is trying to address by “connecting consumers to merchants and measuring that in meaningful ways” by reaching them in moments of transaction.
“If you don’t have a sense of how to connect with users in these moments and if you can’t provide your brand or experience in a frictionless method, users in this minute or two of time are going to see it as too much frustration or as a waste and will let it go and move on to something else,” he said.
“If there are obstacles in their way they simply give up. It’s not like there aren’t other brands, merchants and marketers out there willing to capture the user’s attention and time.”
One way of doing this is cross-device measurement according to Alferness, who said Google is developing a framework called Estimated Total Conversions that will provide marketers with the total value they’re getting from their marketing spend across different devices.
“We’re now able to report back to marketers how much of their advertising spend actually drove consumers into stores,” he explained
He stressed that it is also important to provide a more personalised experience for the consumer.
“The more personalised the experience you can give the user the less forced it will feel,” he added.
“As we evolve we’re going to get to the point where I understand you and what your needs are well enough that I can give you the answers to the question before you even ask it.”
This is all in an effort to “evolve the digital advertising ecosystem” through the “massive shift” Alferness said is occurring in mobile.
He added that personalisation is one step along the way to what he sees as the future – a digital assistant.
“I still think that we are at the beginning stages of digital marketing, especially of mobile digital marketing,” he said. “In the shopping context I think a lot about the future and how we can develop a personal shopping assistant.”
The service he imagines would provide recommendations to a user based on previous purchases, preferences and location.
“I see more of an intersection of the work that we’re doing in personalisation and machine and artificial intelligence and tying that to make a assistant that helps the user through this fragmented journey,” he said.
I read the above article with interest. In order to build the picture of the customer that is referenced by Alferness, brands must understand the
customer data that they are handling. This means going far beyond purchase,
preference and location data:  understanding intent through adding browse
data can give brands even more richness and insight – it gives them actionable
intelligence. 
With a single source of data brands can be sure that they are
working with not only a consistent, but also a highly granular dataset, rather
than relying on trying to merge disparate sets of data from a potentially wide
variety of sources. Having data consistency and clarity means the data should
be put into the hands of the decision makers throughout the business and
constantly used to inform decisions – whether that is making long-term
decisions such as product planning using website interaction behaviour to
indicate latent demand, tactical decisions such as in-store merchandising on
any given afternoon based on online product browsing and purchase behaviour
that morning, or complex decisions such as price optimisation and revenue
management. Data is critical and should be the driving force behind all
decisions. 
Forward-thinking brands are putting good quality, comprehensive
real-time data at the heart of their organisation. It is no longer about
looking at the numbers and reacting a week later. The path to the future of
marketing is no longer single track and one way – it has become a roaring
motorway that twists and turns at a moment’s notice. Those organisations that
have an agile approach can react at the speed of the consumer, real-time or
otherwise, and achieve the flexibility needed to be winners in this customer
driven marketplace.
Marketers are still not ready to fully put their faith into mobile, even at the most basic level, and “criminally” failing to personalise the experience, according to Google’s sales director Martijn Bertisen, who was speaking at today’s annual IAB Mobile Engage event.
Brands are under pressure to improve their mobile websites following an update to Google’s search algorithm that favours sites optimised for mobile devices.
Google previously tried to open a store with its Chrome brand, but its offering has stretched to the ‘Google’ brand as the company looks to increase interaction for consumers, which might suggest that physical stores are here to stay.
Diageo is launching an appeal after the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned a TV ad for its Smirnoff brand for implying the success of social occasions was dependent on alcohol.

Last week was Econsultancy’s Future of Digital Marketing event. This was the tenth year we had run it – a whole decade of digital futures that we can now look back on. Trawling through the archives of presentations and topics, what can we learn?
In its early years the event was called, ‘What’s new in online marketing’ (or the not so catchy acronym WNIOM). The name change itself from ‘online’ to ‘digital’ shows one of the shifts over time. In the early days of digital in the UK we tended to talk about ‘new media’ while in the US it leaned towards ‘e-something’. ‘New media’ morphed to ‘interactive’  and ‘online’ in the noughties and we are now in the decade of ‘digital’.
These semantic shifts reflect the realisation over time that digital is not just about media or marketing, it is not just about web or online, it is not necessarily interactive and it is certainly
no longer new. Which begs the question as to what ‘digital’ will become by the end of this decade? If you were setting up a business now you probably would not feel it sensible to label
it as ‘e-something’ or ‘interactive’ or even ‘[something] digital’?
Of course there were some developments that were exciting at the time but did not amount to much – virtual worlds and IPTV come to mind. Looking back at our event programmes and topics there are some that evoke a wry smile:
“Online PR – should we be blogging?” Perhaps more obvious now, but this was 2006.
“Social media – do you really need to have a presence on the likes of MySpace?” From 2007’s agenda.“Desktop marketing – with Microsoft’s new Vista platform, the growth in desktop gadgets and RSS alerts, how seriously should you be taking the desktop as a digital marketing
arena? How does this ‘desktop’ extend to mobile and TV devices?” Also from 2007, this sounds both completely misguided in its specifics and yet very prescient in concept as we now address cross-device experiences and digital ‘cards’ that can be shared and embedded across ecosystems and platforms.
“Multichannel marketing – will digital plateau out? How will online and offline work together best?” For 2008 that is sounding impressively of the current moment.
In fact, 2008 turned out to be a vintage year for visions of the digital marketing future that have proved uncannily accurate. For example, Alison Lancaster, then marketing director at
Charles Tyrwhitt, painted a vision for the future of retail titled, “From e-tail to me-tail”, which talked about multichannel business models, outstanding customer experiences, personalisation, the digital talent challenge, the importance of agility, culture and innovation. Ring any bells?
We have been through an era where the future of digital was largely about mastering new disciplines such as email and search marketing, though there is still plenty of that, for example content marketing, mobile commerce, video, etc.
We went through the web 2.0 era, which was largely about social media and understanding the people-to-people power of digital.
It feels like we are now in a digital era that is still not short on new things to master (data, omnichannel, personalisation) or new horizons to imagine (wearables, internet of things, 3D printing, artificial intelligence) but which is more fundamentally about the ability of brands and businesses to change, adapt and innovate.
After 10 years of presentations which often ended “Change or die”, it seems that cautionary prediction for the future of digital is indeed coming to pass.
Three ways marketers can grow brand equity in the face of unprecedented price drops
Take away the slick launch event, and Apple’s latest innovation is a me-too product years behind its rivals. However, its sure-fire success is a far better exemplar of the power of branding than genuine product innovations such as the Apple Mac or the iPhone.
Despite launching only two years ago, BT Sport has quickly become one of the main sports broadcasters in the UK. Now, with its exclusive Champions and Europa League broadcasting rights kicking off this summer, it is pushing a ‘major new chapter’ with the launch of its new ‘Ultra HD’ 4K channel.
Many big beasts of the brand landscape showed themselves to be dinosaurs when confronted by digital competition. Avoiding extinction takes a willingness to change.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.
The laundry app’s chief Ed Relf on building brands by focusing on trust and why marketers make the best entrepreneurs.

ISBA and the IPA have warned that brands are still not properly considering the ramifications of social media use.
Today (June 9th) the advertising bodies announced two new framework contract templates to help boost productivity between clients and agencies.
Within the new framework templates, ISBA and the IPA suggest that agencies should regularly update clients on changes to social media laws, change social media passwords to avoid hacking from disgruntled employees (referencing the recent HMV debacle), and also attain prior approval of content generated by brand ambassadors such as celebrities.
The latter has seen many brands fall foul of the ASA after ambassadors have tweeted about products without #ad and #spon disclosures, according to Debbie Morrison, ISBA’s director for consultancy and best practice.
She told Marketing Week: “We’ve still not seen any contracts between brands and agencies which feature adequate legal guidelines for social.
“I spoke to one major multinational retailer as it was called in by the ASA after a celebrity tweeted about a campaign without using the proper ad hashtags. When I asked them what was in their contract, they didn’t even have one.”
She added: “If Google is saying artificial intelligence is the next big thing for marketers you fear when brands and agencies still are still failing to get their heads around the legal ramifications of social.”
Other changes introduced include transparency around contract cancellations. The IPA and ISBA have suggested that clients, should they cancel an agency contract, must pay for all committed third party costs.
There has also been revisions to intellectual property with brands encouraged to agree separate royalty streams for agencies that generate characters that have a life after a campaign ends.
Debs Carter, marketing director for SHS Drinks, which owns drink brands including WKD and Shloer, welcomed today’s revisions.
She said: “The introduction of different schedules such as social is a real reflection of changing consumer touch points and will be mutually beneficial for negotiations between agencies and clients.
“When you start a relationship with a new agency you must be clear on what is expected. Especially on social as in the alcohol industry you learn fast that user generated content is a big problem.”
Marketing Week’s key takeaways from ISBA’s Annual Conference, including the decline of consumer trust in the advertising industry, the perks and pitfalls of the use of vloggers by brands and preventing crisis in the online world.
Social media is the darling of the communications mix but we must be careful of not using social for the sake of it by ensuring that everybody’s voice is heard, no matter how it is communicated. By Amanda Moulson, Miniushka Hughes, and Tinni Guha Roy at Emanate PR.
Research by Cision UK finds that while the effects of social media on PRs have been positive, any increasing dependence on social as a primary medium of communication can be hazardous, so view the channel as complementary to other efforts, advises Priyanka Dayal.

If programmatic actually works and connects the worlds of social, digital and traditional media, we have a potential solution for what ails marketers worldwide.
There was an interesting interview with Bacardi’s CMO Dmitry Ivanov in the Australian marketing magazine Mumbrella last week. He was quick to acknowledge that he “sits in the camp” of those who believe that TV is a medium in decline. Asked whether he believed TV had become less relevant for a company like Bacardi, his answer was unequivocal. “I would agree with that,” Ivanov told the magazine, “and it is proven by… how much time the younger generation spend watching any TV programme.”
Obviously, as the CMO of a giant company like Bacardi, Ivanov has access to swathes of complex and expensive data that your humble columnist isn’t party to. Far be it for me to suggest that he should take another long hard look at actual audience data to check his facts and the gloomy prediction of TV’s imminent downfall. But that wasn’t what caught my eye from his interview. It’s what he said next.
Ivanov announced that Bacardi would soon make its first steps into the world of programmatic through a partnership with global media agency OMD Worldwide. “It makes logical sense for some of the people we are trying to track and to be more relevant in their lives,” he explained. “People are talking about programmatic and we want to head down a more digital path.”
Programmatic is a new concept for most and, even by the lightening-fast adoption standards of our industry, it has entered the marketing lexicon quickly. Nonetheless, Ivanov’s comments are puzzling. Surely the big data, artificial intelligence, Age of Ultron promise of the programmatic era dispels the need for these bold medium-specific pronouncements. Isn’t the whole ethos of programmatic driven by the belief in a data-driven model of real-time media neutrality?
If that’s the case, it’s also an oxymoron for Bacardi to justify its move to programmatic because it wants to “head down a more digital path”. The era of deciding which path you want to head down as a CMO is over. Bacardi’s post-programmatic direction is a veritable street atlas of ever unfolding and expanding streets travelled at lightening speeds and navigated by a system free from human interference or bias.
Again, far be it for me to correct an experienced CMO, but Bacardi is missing the ultimate value of programmatic. Yes, it maximises a brand’s ability to impact its chosen target segments – especially the younger ones who, for generations, have mystified the middle-aged managers charged with targeting them. And yes, it helps to navigate the increasingly complex diaspora of digital options. It might even get better bang for a brand’s buck too. But just focusing on these immediate tactical advantages misses the biggest strategic benefit.
If programmatic is truly data driven and it can eventually connect the worlds of social, digital and traditional media, then we have a potential solution for what ails marketers worldwide. As Ivanov so notably illustrates, most marketers talk digital and promote social at the expense of less trendy “traditional” tools. If this was the noughties, that would lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which media budgets would swing heavily away from less sexy (but often more effective) tools such as radio and TV in favour of trendy social fare with cool street-cred and crappy impact.
But programmatic has come along at just the right time. If it really does what it says on the tin – and we have to wait a few more years to discover what the bullshit quotient is – programmatic solves the increasingly tricky challenge of marketers going gaga over hot, new but ineffective tools and ignoring less sexy and more effective ones. In a post-programmatic age, CMOs are fundamentally not driving the bus anymore. The bus is driving the bus. And the bus has a sophisticated satnav that ignores the horseshit being spouted by its geriatric owner and is merrily calculating the best route to market on a second by second basis as it makes an efficient and effective journey at top speed across the globe.
Every great villain needs a nemesis. Batman arrived just in time to foil the Joker. Churchill sorted out Hitler. And now programmatic arrives just in time to take care of the sloppy, socially infected world of marketing.
Fascinating. Programmatic has a lot to prove and could be the Holy Grail. BUT…. The media industry is due to go through something akin to the automation of the financial markets in the 1980’s and we all know where that lead the banks. They lost the human touch and then ultimately our trust. Sure, I’m getting on a bit but I will always want to deal with agency people. Its part of what makes the job fun and then there’s all those fabulous lunches………..
Marketing Week and Econsultancy’s first ‘Get with the Programmatic’ brought together brands, agencies and technology companies to discuss trends, share best practice and growth opportunities.
Brands’ spending on programmatic display ads online exploded in 2014, but this year marks a concerted move to adopt it in other marketplaces including video, mobile and even TV advertising. So how far can programmatic go?
Ok, I have to be honest. I had never heard of R3. Apparently in its day job R3 helps companies maximise their agency reviews, remunerations and relationships – hence the name. I have no idea if it is any good at any of those tasks, but it surely has done every marketer a favour with its new report on marketing communications published this week.
Last week’s Marketing Week Live 2015 saw some of the biggest names from the some of the UK’s biggest brands regaling and enlightening attendees with invaluable information they can take back to their brands to help them do their jobs better.  There were many nuggets but the dominant takeaway for me was the way brands are turning data into insight to drive business performance.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.

Let us start with the bombshell. There isn’t anything new on the digital marketing horizon for 2015 that excites me much. In previous years entire new disciplines emerged. Last year was big for content marketing, data, native advertising, programmatic. Before that we had marketing automation, inbound marketing and going back further still social, mobile, video and so on.
But there is good news. I remain very excited about digital marketing and ecommerce for 2015. Not because of all the more specific innovations and changes but because of three bigger overarching trends I predict for this year.
Of course creativity and design never went away. But I believe it will dawn upon marketers and business people more generally what a premium creativity and design should command and their value will come again to the fore. Why? And why now for 2015?
For at least the last decade the excitement has largely been driven by rapid technological innovation and the huge shifts in consumer behaviour brought about largely by the internet and mobile. More recently data and automation opportunities have continued to excite. All understandably and rightly so.
But Apple’s CEO Tim Cook recently challenged us all to ask ourselves as businesses “What comes after the internet?” My wife, right up there with Tim Cook in defining the future, recently observed “science fiction has caught up with itself”. Of course technology will continue to evolve rapidly and no doubt there will be another internet-like breakthrough at some point. But for where we are right now we have plenty enough tech to do amazing things. What we are lacking is good ideas and the interactive design craft needed to apply what is already possible to create transformational value.
You probably know that you can use data feeds, from the weather to share prices to trending music sales to stock availability and more, in order to real-time optimise advertising creative? You probably know you can tap into your CRM data in real time via APIs to create custom audiences that you can lifecycle retarget with digital marketing from social to content to email to ads?
All powerful stuff. But what is the idea? What are the behavioural triggers you will use? What is the customer journey flow across channels and what are the creative and design treatments for those hundreds of dynamically served and personalised experiences? How does this all support the brand promise? Who is responsible for the cohesive vision that is not only technically enlightened but actually engages creatively, emotionally and commercially?
The engineers have been the rock stars of digital for a long time. They deserve to be and will remain critical. But for 2015 the real gold dust in terms of people and capabilities will be those customer experience architect, product management and creative technologist types who have ideas, who can inspire with a vision, who can lead teams to design and deliver undeniably better customer experiences. The fact that they understand the technology, the data, the multichannel customer experience and the commercial objectives is a given. We need inspired hypotheses. We need good ideas and brilliant design execution.
Of course marketing ‘optimisation’ in its many performance-driven forms has a long way to run yet and is never finished. But, to paraphrase Tim Cook, ‘what comes after optimization?’ You have made your site responsive, you have copied Amazon’s checkout process, your PPC is running efficiently, you are pumping out persona-driven content mapped to the customer journey, you are actually quite good at social, and you are omnifying your channels. But when will this run out of steam? Will it deliver a step change or only incremental improvements that barely keep up with your customers’ expectations?
Creative thinking is needed to make bigger leaps. Which is why big companies are so unsettled by the likes of AirBnB and Uber. They are looking for their own equivalents. Incrementalism may not be enough; disruptive, creative thinking is at a premium not just in digital marketing but in the boardroom.
I posited this last year as an emerging trend in marketing, particularly digital. It is starting to happen but I expect to see more over 2015 and beyond. It not just technology that is moving towards thinking about platforms and services. Marketing and entire business processes and models are moving that way. Away from the static and the linear and the planned; towards the fluid, ongoing and agile.
Take IBM’s Bluemix – a cloud-based platform for building, managing, and running apps of all types. Take Google’s Material design – a codified visual language and set of design and interaction patterns. Efforts are being made across technology and design to enable efficiencies, scale, consistency and replicability without compromising creativity and freedom of expression.
The same is happening in marketing. For example, if we can create shared content, marketing or data assets, and define unifying taxonomies and data architectures, then we can get much smarter, and more efficient, when delivering personalisation at scale. We can begin to segment and target in creative ways. We can more rapidly deploy our marketing in reactive ways.
If you consider many of the tech developments – programmatic, automation, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, self-learning systems – they feed off, and are driven by data. But most still need human expertise to be trained and tuned to work really well. Increasingly our role as marketers will be to train these systems, to infuse them and instruct them with our brand’s DNA, to help architect the data to be particularly relevant for our customers, to orchestrate the rules and triggers driving the system, to choreograph the frequency and nature of interactions with our customers and prospects. Once we have our marketing platform our job will be more about marketing service design than doing campaigns and collateral.
There has been a lot of investment in digital over the last decade and it continues to grow. There has also been a realisation that customer-centricity really is a source of sustainable competitive advantage and organisations are starting to walk the talk. Witness the rise of board-level roles with the word ‘customer’ in them.
But we are a long way yet from the seamless, omnichannel, personalised customer experiences we all talk about. To deliver on that promise we need to connect a lot of dots. Only then will the digital and marketing engine start to purr efficiently rather than stutter as it does currently. We have a lot of dots to connect. We need to join up data, we need to integrate technology systems, we need online and offline to become joined up.
But it goes well beyond that. We need to connect dots in our processes and operational practices to enable, for example, agile ways of working. We need to connect dots in our organisational structures to enable multi-disciplinary teams and multichannel thinking. We need to connect dots in the skills, knowledge and capabilities of our people. We need to think of marketing as an ecosystem that is nonlinear and always on, that is more modular. Truly delivering on customer-centricity requires us to join lots of dots. This may not be sexy but it is important and most of us will spend 2015 trying to connect more dots.
So we have a lot to do. And whilst there may not be any single trend or discipline in digital that excites me for 2015 it feels like we are at a tipping point where all the component parts are now available, as well as the will, to apply all that digital can offer in creative, engaging, even disruptive, ways to transform customer experiences and, indeed, entire business models.
I’m a final year student at Bournemouth University, and as part of my digital marketing module, we will form in groups to enter the Google Online Marketing Challenge 2015. Therefore, I think the increase of Google AdWords will be a major development for 2015, through creating brand protection over the AdWords used to search for branded products, without the consumer being led into fraud fake purchases, such as the black market. This will then allow brands to make a higher profit, as more of their products will be purchased from the original brand and not fake copies, that mislead the consumer to unofficial purchasing sites. So brand protection over Google AdWords is my prediction for the marketing trend of 2015. I’d love to hear your thoughts, katieponsford57@hotmail.com
In this article, author Ashley Friedlein discusses the presence digital marketing holds in our current day and age. It is hard for one to rebuttal against the claim that as technology changes and develops, so does everything around it. Just how we as humans are impacted by changes in technology, so is virtually everything else, even disciplines such as marketing. This all being said, as our world becomes more electronically driven through the increasing use of the internet and devices such as computers, tablets, and smartphones, so do many trends in marketing. A prime and rather simplistic example of this can be displayed by looking at where/how many brands are being advertised. Over the past decade, many companies are abandoning former vehicles of marketing such as those in published media (i.e. newspapers, magazines, ect.). Furthermore, even billboards and other non-digital methods of advertising seem that they are becoming less sought after or utilized. In my opinion, this movement is due to companies wanting to target consumers in more penetrated areas (in this case, digital platforms). Putting these new advertising tactics aside, it is important that we also look at how they are being used. Friedlein mentions that her predictions for the future of digital marketing are not so much geared towards technological change, but instead new efforts and practices being implemented to best utilize the current technologies we have at our disposal.

If Stephen Hawking is right, and machines start to think for themselves and use intuition to second-guess the vagaries of human beings, we have an intriguing future ahead.
One of the most interesting stories at the end of last year was Stephen Hawking’s prophecies about artificial intelligence (AI) and the suggestion that machines would take over the world. Although science fiction films have predicted this for decades – from Westworld to The Terminator and many in between – it is a frightening, but half-believable, consequence of the speed with which technology is moving.
In some ways you can see the advantages of AI. Rather than sending soldiers ‘over the top’ in the Great War, using battalions of replaceable metal to face their fate would have made a lot of sense.
However, the problem with this, as those who have played the countless online war games can confirm, is that it is the nations with the ‘most tin’ that always prevail – which in itself is a shuddering thought, especially as we look back on our own exploits in battle and realise we were frequently the ones with less men, although we had the winning strategy.
And then I look to our own industry – Amazon extending its trials of delivery drones, call centres and interactive voice response (IVR), remote service providers and chat systems, supermarkets persevering with automated tills, banks with smarter ATM machines, and of course, my colleagues convinced that marketing automation is the way to go.
The reality is that there are incredibly exciting things happening in the world right now. For me, too many of them are still dumb or blunt – but if Hawking is right, and machines start to think for themselves and use intuition to second-guess the vagaries of a human being, the future could be intriguing.
While programming computers with multiple scenarios is relatively straightforward, as those pushing marketing automation systems are well aware, you can never plan for every eventuality, and often failing to recognise this results in embarrassing your brand.
But if we genuinely do believe that before long your Secret Marketer will be a bot who strings a few words together to make a pithy blog each week, why is it that I still can’t make a mobile phone call on a train or get reliable Wi-Fi in my flat when a bus goes past; and why does my local Tesco self-scanning till still believe that I have removed something from the packing area, when I haven’t? I think the human race still has a few years left.
Amazon is developing unmanned drones to deliver parcels as it seeks to cut delivery times and improve the convenience of online shopping. 
Marketing Week visitied Somo and spoke to the mobile solution agency’s drone experts Maani Safa, vice president of creative and innovation, and Naji El-Arifi, product innovation manager, to discover whether drones have a marketing use case or if they are just a geeky gimmick.
Here are Marketing Week’s predictions for the technologies that will dominate marketing and consumer behaviour next year.
Marketers are not famed for their honesty but next year could be the year of being ‘insanely honest’, as social media and consumer demand pushes transparency to the fore.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.
The laundry app’s chief Ed Relf on building brands by focusing on trust and why marketers make the best entrepreneurs.

The Google memo by engineer James Damore, attacking the company for pursuing gender diversity, shows how damaging it is to make sex-based assumptions – but it also reveals big political problems for the web giant.

From drones to wearables, which consumer tech should marketers place their bets on?
Las Vegas has always seemed like an appropriate location for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES): a city built on innovation and gambling that this week welcomes brands from around the world to place their bets on new technology for the year ahead. Rapid digital advances have seen CES grow to host a predicted 150,000 visitors this week, with many marketers likely to be among them.
More than ever, marketers today must be able to stand up and make a case to their business about which new technologies offer real promise – whether as new consumer products, new marketing channels or the basis of a new brand proposition. So, for those who are not at CES, what are the big tech trends that brands and marketers should look out for as they plan their strategies for 2015?
CES senior vice-president Karen Chupka suggests that this year will see increasing infiltration of technology in all manner of products. One consequence will be higher levels of ‘intuition’ from smart products and the brands that use them. While artificial intelligence – man-made technology that thinks entirely for itself – still resides in the realm of science fiction, there are plenty of inventions in Las Vegas this week that demonstrate the learning capabilities of inanimate objects.
The show’s robotics area is hosting everything “from humanoid entertainment devices to robotic cleaning machines”, according to its publicity, while Chupka believes such technology could lead to big advancements in areas such as home entertainment and children’s toys in the coming years.
“Last year, there was a teddy bear [on display] that was able to interact with children – it’s designed to help autistic children by reacting to them and helping them to learn how to connect with people at an early age,” she explains. “There are more products like that coming out and more commercial uses for some of this technology.”
The smart software powering these products coming to market is known as ‘augmented intelligence’ or ‘machine learning’. Examples already available include voice-activated personal assistants loaded onto smartphones, such as Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google Now, which not only respond to requests for information, but also adapt their answers over time by integrating data on the user’s preferences and behaviour.
Although this technology is advancing quickly, a review of Cortana in PC World magazine last year noted that these digital assistants “haven’t yet mastered the ability to tell us what we need even before we ask”.
“The idea isn’t for the machines to take over. They shouldn’t be there to replace you, but rather as an extension of your need, anticipating that need. We see this as the future”
Cloud-based note gathering service Evernote is seeking to offer a similar level of pre-emptive intelligence through its new ‘context’ function. Launched last October in partnership with business and financial publisher Dow Jones, the function offers links to articles that it thinks will be relevant to the user based on the content of their notes and their use of the platform.
The function complements other intuitive Evernote features including image recognition technology that allows users to search for content from handwritten notes that they have uploaded as images. Evernote, which aims to have a presence across all connected devices including wearables and home appliances, also provides notes and content suggestions according to the appointments in a user’s calendar.
“The idea isn’t for the machines to take over,” says European general manager Cristina Riesen. “They shouldn’t be there to replace you, but rather as an extension of your need, anticipating that need. We see this as the future.”
Image recognition looks set to play an increasingly important role in this type of intuitive brand experience. At the end of last year, UK technology start-up Neurence unveiled an app that enables people to scan physical objects or sounds with their phone in order to find related content online. The app, named Sense, differs from other smartphone scanning tools such as QR code readers by allowing anybody to upload and categorise any image or sound.
Charlotte Golunski, co-founder of Sense, explains that even when an image is not stored in its cloud-based system, the app uses machine learning to provide “a base level” of information. “The software is constantly indexing the internet in the same way that Google does,” she says.
Sense has already tested the technology by running a marketing campaign with pop group The Vamps whereby fans could use their phone or wearable device to detect an image of the band’s album cover and win the chance to have a video chat with the band. Sense recently launched its software development kit (SDK) for brands that wish to integrate the technology into their own apps.
For marketers, the applications for such capabilities run wide and deep: “Booking a holiday from looking at a postcard, buying tickets for your favourite band when you walk past a poster or using audio recognition to translate in real time and conduct a conversation in a different language will all become a reality,” claims Golunski.
CES’s Chupka also believes the ‘internet of things’ looks set to take on a life of its own this year.
“One of the biggest things that is changing the world of technology is sensors – how they are being built into products and giving products the ability to measure things and understand the world around them,” says Chupka. “The whole idea that everything is connected and that everything has a way of sharing data and being smart about you is driving a lot of the technology stories at CES.”
Notable products on show this year include a wearable device that allows women to measure when they are most likely to conceive a baby and automated systems to help cars avoid accidents. In addition to the broad theme of the internet of things, CES 2015 will also showcase huge advances in both software and hardware. This year’s conference is the first to have a dedicated area for drones, for example, while robotic exhibits are up by 25% on 2014.
It is not only technology companies with an interest in these developments, either. A huge range of brands are visiting Nevada this week, aware of the need to adapt their business models to the latest tech and consumers’ changing behaviour.
Procter & Gamble, Unilever and McDonald’s are some of the big names in attendance, while L’Oreal is exhibiting for the first time in the wearables area of the show as it looks to bring its health and wellbeing products into the digital age. “It’s very difficult to define what is a tech company these days,” notes Chupka.
Andy Hobsbawm, founder of Evrythng, a software company that specialises in connecting objects to the internet of things, believes that the rise of smart products will lead to an increased demand for seamless experiences that allow consumers to connect all products together in one place. This, he suggests, will prompt a fundamental shift in brands’ digital strategies in favour of online ‘ecosystems’.
“We’re going to see an explosion of product apps and that will result in an app backlash. Having to open 10 different apps for 10 different products isn’t going to work – we don’t live our lives like that. Apps will become subsumed into the mobile web and there will be a move to join these things in an ecosystem,” says Hobsbawm.
“Apps will become subsumed into the mobile web and there will be a move to join these things in an ecosystem”
In recent months there have been numerous cases of big technology firms joining forces in order to facilitate these ecosystems. Last August, for example, home appliances group Electrolux became the latest technology company to join the AllSeen Alliance, an internet of things project that also counts Haier, LG, Microsoft and Panasonic among its members.
The companies are working together to build an open source software framework called AllJoyn that aims to act as a universal translator for objects and devices to interact, regardless of brand and other infrastructure considerations.
“Electrolux strongly believes that this technology, where appliances communicate with each other, with consumers and with other devices, offers a great potential to develop products and services that improve how we cook our food and clean our homes,” says Jan Brockmann, chief technology officer at Electrolux.
Hobsbawm argues that the marketing potential of smart products is huge, though he believes that brand activations must provide clear benefits for the consumer. He suggests, for example, that brands can extend their engagement with customers by inviting them to ‘friend’ their appliance on social media in order to receive additional rewards.
Another suggestion is for connected appliances to provide users with online advice or contact details for repair services when they breakdown. “Companies need to figure out what makes a good connected experience,” he says.
Connected experiences will also usher in heightened levels of cooperation between different brands as they look to provide additional content and services to consumers. Jaguar Land Rover recently launched a SDK to accompany its new, smartphone-enabled connected car system justDrive – a move that will allow a variety of third parties to develop apps for the platform.
However, the company’s head of connected car Mike Bell says external software must work seamlessly in its connected system, which uses intelligent voice command technology to help drivers navigate, send messages and access apps.
“You don’t want Angry Birds being enabled through our touchscreen – that wouldn’t send out the right message. It needs to be safe, driver-centric and the brand fit needs to be right.”
One type of device guaranteed to make a splash in 2015 is the smartwatch, thanks to the impending launch of the Apple Watch, which is reportedly scheduled for spring. Many smartwatches are already available to buy, so wearable opportunities extend far beyond the Apple hype, but in 2015 brands will need to take a view on how widely smartwatches will be adopted and to understand what is required for brands to reach consumers through the various devices. The exhibition space for smartwatches at CES has more than doubled in size this year compared to 2014.
Karen Chupka at CES notes that wearable devices now include a wide range of clothing items, with athletics brand Under Armour among those exhibiting a line of sensor enabled sports tops that allow people to monitor their performance online. “That feeds into the wider evolution of sports equipment, with digitally connected balls and so on,” she explains.
Wearable specialists are also opening up their technology in a bid to develop new partnerships. Last September, maker of the Shine wristband Misfit announced it is working with over 30 partners who are integrating its activity – and sleep-tracking capabilities into their own products. These include fitness apps such as Lose It! and RunKeeper, but also non-technology brands like Coca-Cola, which has its own branded wristband as a result of the collaboration.
David Butler, vice-president of innovation at Coca-Cola, confirms that the company is keen to extend its presence in wearables and the wider internet of things. Its wristband product is available for sale in Apple stores in the US, where Misfit has a retail deal, and to employees as part of its internal wellbeing programme. As reported last year, Coca-Cola is investing in start-up technology ventures via its new Founders network, as it looks to diversify revenues and strengthen its digital capabilities.
Butler says: “Sensors cover everything – from all the touch points we have in the world like our delivery vehicles and our equipment, right down to the ‘biomarker’ level that can measure how hydrated you are and the effects of that on your body.
“We’re looking at all of that – large-scale sensors, all the way down to predictive analytics around the human body.”
Brands aiming to take advantage of leading-edge technologies have a significant amount of work to do to drive adoption and awareness, despite the hype generated by events such as the Consumer Electronics Show. New research by Ipsos MediaCT shows that only 49% of British adults have heard of cloud computing, while 44% are aware of smartwatches and 33% know about smart glasses. Only 4% of people currently use smart home technology, while 6% own a wearable device.
Not all innovations need to be revolutionary, of course. Barclaycard has integrated contactless payment chips into objects as simple as gloves; its PayTag sticker, which attaches to the back of a phone; and its bPay smart wristband. The latter offers the potential for brands to extend their engagement with consumers by connecting it to social media or loyalty schemes, though Barclaycard sees it more as a means to grow contactless payments.
“The UK is one of the leading markets for contactless payment, so while tangentially this is the internet of things, I think about it more in terms of driving contactless and the whole mobile payments wave,” says Mike Saunders, head of digital payments at Barclaycard.
Regulatory barriers may stand in the way of some marketers who are tempted by the flashiest hardware. For example, Amazon and Google are currently testing commercial uses of remote-controlled drones for delivering goods. However, large-scale applications remain a long way off and there are doubts about safety, since passenger planes in both the US and UK reported near-misses with drones in 2014.
“The regulatory side needs to come into better focus and certain technological aspects need to be improved,” says Michael Perry, a spokesperson for drones developer DJI. “But next year we will also see lots of innovation and creativity from the people who are already thinking about how these tools can change the world.”
Small and shrewd emerging brands are taking on big names and shaking up markets that seemed set in stone. But can established companies use these newcomer tactics to their own advantage?
Natural language processing, combined with geo-location, behavioural and attitudinal data, brings marketers nearer to their real-time marketing goal, says HP’s global customer executive.
Apple’s “one last thing” at its annual iPhone launch event last night (9 September) was the much-anticipated Watch, but the verdict is still out as to whether Apple’s first wearable will be marketed clearly to give it enough consumer appeal to jumpstart the “Stone Age” wearable market.

Once upon a time, to become a marketer you simply had to go to a good marketing school, get a marketing degree, join the marketing department of a good marketing company and pursue your marketing career.
Sure, there were always internal challenges: the R&D person who didn’t want to create the perfect formula for your grandiose product idea or the sales person who didn’t want to list your amazing brand despite your soon-to-air blockbuster TV ad. But the outside world was known and relatively stable.
Last Monday, as I reflected on my working day, it struck me that 100 per cent of my time had been spent with people and thinking about topics that wouldn’t have been on the radar of a typical marketer just two or three years ago. For example:
And these were topics from just a single day, not to mention the new normal of digital, mobile and social spaces.
The reality is that in this ever-faster changing and always more complex world, the idea of a marketing generalist, who learns early and forever knows the rules of the game, has disappeared.
With the current access to knowledge and the speed of change, everyone is a potential marketer. And that means the marketer needs to be able to understand and work with everyone else. The data scientist. The brand publisher. The relationship manager. The artificial intelligence engineer. The start-up entrepreneur. Even the consumer.
Today’s world of marketing is full of new skills and paved with new abilities to enable us to create the best marketing ever for the people we serve. To let us always stay ahead of the ever-changing game. To make us always more curious and brave and to bring the outside in. To spot and act fast, to start and scale faster. To deploy or to die.
To many, I know this is scary. Personally, I find it incredibly energising, as this is the marketer’s final frontier. For now at least. Our next five-year mission is to explore these strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no marketer has gone before.
These are the voyages of the marketer’s new enterprise!

The ice bucket challenge has been almost impossible to miss for anyone on Facebook or Twitter with millions of people throwing buckets of water over their head and donating money to charities including Macmillan and the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MDNA). Both have seen a big increase in donations, but is there a longer term benefit of these viral campaigns?
Marks & Spencer’s claim that its “trusted brand” can create a successful alternative in M&S Bank to the UK’s high street banking giants has been given weight by data that finds perception of its financial services brand far exceeds the majority of high street banking giants.

Snow Fall is a beautiful, interactive and immersive multimedia experience about the avalanche at Tunnel Creek in the US. It was lovingly crafted by The New York Times in 2012 and was heralded as setting new standards in digital storytelling.
Seventeen months later, the publication’s internal innovation report was leaked. It points out that while projects such as Snow Fall are extremely popular, with more than 21 million page views, they are not easily replicable.
The report acknowledged that “we have a tendency to pour resources into big one-time projects and work through the one-time fixes needed to create them and overlook the less glamorous work of creating tools, templates and permanent fixes that cumulatively can have a bigger impact by saving our digital journalists time and elevating the whole report. We greatly undervalue replicability.” In a memorable quote from Quartz editor Kevin Delaney, “I’d rather have a Snow Fall builder than a Snow Fall.”
Isn’t marketing, particularly digital, undergoing a similar change? We love a great campaign but perhaps they are not as valuable as creating a marketing infrastructure and set of marketing processes and capabilities that can deliver replicability. This does not mean that marketing should be normalised but if we can create the right building blocks, including data, content assets, rules and logic, then we can create ‘composable’ marketing that is unique in discrete executions, yet more scalable, efficient and quicker to execute.
I have encouraged marketers to learn from the world of technology before. Agile marketing can borrow from agile software development.  You should be aware of software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud-based software. Should we not be thinking of marketing-as-a-service (MaaS)? If we can create marketing components that we can assemble on demand, then we can deliver new marketing experiences quickly and effectively.
Consider digital advertising campaigns. Mondelez’s vice-president of media and consumer engagement B. Bonin Bough recently said that he expected all media to be bought programmatically. Procter & Gamble has stated it aims to buy 70-75 per cent of its US digital media programmatically by the end of this year. American Express also suggested that it wants to shift 100 per cent of digital buys to programmatic.
What becomes most valuable is less the specific creative execution, or individual campaign, and more the underlying models, frameworks and algorithms. To paraphrase Kevin Delaney’s Snow Fall comment, “I’d rather have an optimisation model for programmatic media buying than a great ad campaign”.
How about content marketing? Infographics have proved popular but creating great infographics as one-offs is time consuming and expensive. Using chart and graphic-building tools and services, such as Quartz Chartbuilder, makes more sense. Syndicating and distributing content manually is too intensive; again, we need services and platforms to properly power content marketing.
Where could MaaS go? Imagine if we could draw on data sources, query that data and build segments on the fly, pull out marketing building blocks to deliver personalised messaging and experiences that are tailored to specific devices, medium and context of use.
IBM is already doing this in its own marketing. Platforms such as Bluemix and services like Watson (artificial intelligence as a service), enable the company to build propositions such as IBM Voices that allow anyone to discover the most valuable social content shared, created and discussed by IBM thought-leaders and subject matter experts. Made with IBM is a campaign landing site powered by content as a service, delivered dynamically based on business rules.
Many marketers see the future of marketing being about increased personalisation and marketing automation. If that’s the case, they are best powered by MaaS, so I would expect to see this thinking and approach, if not this label, becoming more prevalent.
The RAC is harking back to its heritage with a marketing push that aims to create an emotional connection with members as its owner, Carlyle Group, looks to the future and a possible sale of the motoring group.
In her first interview since taking responsibility for the EE brand, CMO Pippa Dunn tells how she plans to win consumers’ mobile-fickle hearts, improve its ’most complained about’ customer service and build on the awareness of its huge Kevin Bacon campaign.
As a company grows, it can become difficult to ensure that all employees are engaged in its brand and what it stands for. Ensuring that a large workforce buys into the brand promise, however, brings its rewards – even if these are difficult to measure financially.
Over the past week there have been cries of indignation and concern from journalists, the Information Commissioner’s Office and digital rights group the Electronic Privacy Information Center, amongst others, about an experiment it ran on users in 2012 intended to manipulate their emotions. But while the study has raised a lot of noise, the negative PR appears to have had little affect on users opinions of Facebook.

There are few superlatives to describe the way in which Facebook has grown from college student folly to dominating the marketing and media agenda since its launch, then as Thefacebook.com, 10 years ago to the day on 4 February.
If Facebook was a country, it would be the world’s third largest by population and last year the site reached the 1 million advertiser landmark. Every marketer has a Facebook strategy in 2014, but in what form will that take in 2024? Marketing Week takes a look at what the next decade might look like for the world’s largest social network.
Audience
Facebook has been rocked in recent months by reports on its apparent decline. From a Princeton report predicting Facebook will lose 80 per cent of its users by 2017 (which had its methodology widely panned by critics and Facebook itself), to comScore data suggesting teen usage of the site has tailed off as they plump for “cooler” networks like Snapchat and Tumblr – many are calling time on the social network.
But in reality Facebook clearly still has a lot of petrol in the tank. The number of users visiting the site daily in December increased 22 per cent year on year to 757m. More than 1 billion people visited the site on a monthly basis in December, an increase of 49 per cent year on year.
Facebook also has bold ambitions to reach the “next 5 billion” people as part of its mission to “make the world more open and connected”. Last summer Facebook launched internet.org, a partnership with other technology companies that is looking to make affordable internet access available to everyone in the world.
This could in turn impact the way the site develops, as new use cases – that could include anything from mobile payments to health information – become apparent as its audience becomes more diverse.
The rollercoaster relationship with marketers
In its most recent earnings call, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said the company is making “steady progress with brand marketers”. She cited recent improvements to the service Facebook offers marketers, such as the ability to AB test who saw ads on the platform and being able to link those views to sales as well as the roll out of video ads, as proving the “increasingly efficient ROI” the platform delivers. In recent years the company has also formed local marketing advisory boards to help improve its relationships with brands. 
But the path to winning the affection of marketers has been rocky ever since it first launched advertising on the site just a month after its inception. In October 2013 analysts at Forrester published a report claiming Facebook was “failing marketers” by “abandoning” its original promise of social marketing.
The author of the report, Forrester’s vice president and principal analyst Nate Elliott, says almost four months on, marketers remain “disillusioned” with Facebook.
“Save for a tiny handful of marketers that get all kinds of attention and personalised services – and it does make sense to give special attention to your top spenders – they need to get better as right now all they offer [marketers outside the top 100 to 200 spenders by way of service] is a blog.
“Yes their quality of targeting continues to improve but they are sitting behind the pack. And focusing on that ignores the fact that it’s not ads marketers are looking for, it’s marketing. It’s a distinction the industry understands and Facebook does not seem to or care to consider. They have made a decision about what marketing and advertising on Facebook looks like and right now they’ve found the path of least resistance [:display advertising]. I don’t imagine they can keep going like this forever.”
Facebook has not yet shown the ability to replace the value of traditional brand-building media, according to Mark Holden, head of futures at Arena.
He adds: “There are still few cases of new and now established brands being built on Facebook alone. Facebook can make loved brands even more loved, but it hasn’t yet been a vehicle for the launch of a new, loved brand. Facebook still hasn’t ‘cracked’ brand video delivery in a way that rivals what TV, or even YouTube, can do.”
Despite its impressive reach, the ongoing improvements it makes to targeting and a stellar commercial performance to date, Facebook clearly still has work to do over the next 10 years if it is to become the marketing – not just display advertising – medium of choice. And all the while, there are plenty emerging but worthy marketing platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Tumblr and Google+ jostling for marketers’ not-so-undivided attention.
Leadership
Should Facebook consider a change at the top to secure its future – a marketer perhaps? “Definitely not,” according to Jan Rezab, founder and CEO of social media analytics company Socialbakers.
“The hacker culture of Facebook is one they need. Sometimes they do misstep, for example with [the launch of the] Facebook Poke [standalone app], but they quickly learn to do the right thing: like buying Instagram. If I compare this back to Google’s YouTube acquisition – everyone thought it was insane for them to buy it for $1bn, today YouTube makes that in profit every few weeks,” Rezab says.
From humble university dorm beginnings, Zuckerberg has built a formidable commercial leadership team, with his second in command Sheryl Sandberg in particular frequently appearing in “most powerful” or “most influential” lists. Last year she published her international best-selling book “Lean In”, which has incentivised business leaders worldwide to reassess the way they treat women in the workplace.
There have been few notable senior departures from the US Facebook leadership team in recent years. The company appears to have been successful in not only retaining executives, but attracting top talent to the company.
Facebook’s ‘index of data’
One recent recruit was Yann Lecun, the New York Univeristy professor the company hired to lead its artificial intelligence group. The division is designed to help Facebook understand the meaning behind users’ posts and the way in which other data on the platform is connected. Among Facebook’s long-term goals is to “understand the world” and “build the knowledge economy”, according to Zuckerberg. 
One of Facebook’s biggest advantages over other online players is that it has arguably the biggest “index of data” on the net, according to Lexi Brown, Carat communications planning and strategy executive.
She adds: “The development of its own three-tiered data storage solution means that Facebook can quickly access valuable data so that analyses can be performed, insights made and actions implemented. This places the social media platform in a prime position to directly take on Google for dominating search.”
Forrester’s Elliott says “Over the next 10 years my biggest question is: will Facebook build an affinity database?”. Such a platform could help marketers target ads not just own its own site but beyond, opening up untold revenue opportunities.
Apps – it’s Facebook, but not as we know it
In the most recent earnings call, Zuckerberg laid out Facebook’s plans to build more types of standalone services beyond the core Facebook platform.
Facebook quickly followed this up with the launch of Paper, a Flipboard-like social magazine app for iPhone devices. 
While core business growth in the near future will come from the main Facebook platform, as user numbers are so large, the success of already popular standalone apps such as Messenger and Instagram points to a Facebook future beyond the little “F” icon on users’ smartphone homescreens in the decade to follow.

BMW is looking to accelerate take-up of its electric car range in the UK following a partnership with energy provider Good Energy that allows owners of its electric cars to power their vehicles at home with 100 per cent green electricity. 
Owners of the BMW i3 and BMW i8 models will be able to power their vehicles at home using Good Energy’s renewable power sources. Further tie-ups between the pair, including custom-made green electricity tariffs for Electric Vehicles, are also in the pipeline. 
BMWi is the electronic car sub-brand of the manufacturing giant and was launched in 2011 specifically to target motorists in “mega-cities”. Earlier this year, the car marque also launched a Siri-like artificial intelligence SMS information service to help promote and educate consumers about its first ever fully-electric car dubbed ‘iGenius’.
Electric car sales have stuttered in the UK growing at a rate behind the sector for much of the year despite the Government offering incentives to purchase. Sales grew at the fastest rate since they were first recorded in January 2011 in the third quarter, however, up 25 per cent quarter on quarter, according to Government data. 
The deal also provides Good Energy with a further USP in the utilities sector which has been heavily criticised recently due to price-hikes by the majority of the UK’s biggest providers, prompting many consumers to shop around for cheaper alternatives to their existing providers.  
Brands including Bud Light, Jim Beam, Knob Creek, Heineken and Bacardi are among the first to take advantage of changes to Twitter’s age verification process aimed at ensuring alcohol brands have age-appropriate audiences on the network. 
Starbucks is taking part in a pilot scheme with mobile check-in service Foursquare trialling ad formats that let the coffee shop chain target users near its outlets via the app, alongside a host of other brands. 
With the popularity of rum on the rise, Pernod Ricard is increasing the marketing investment for Havana Club but admits tough challenges lay ahead in its efforts to use the brand’s Cuban heritage to dominate the ‘under-premiumised’ category.
Kleenex is launching a multimillion pound marketing campaign that aims to increase use of its tissues by showing that they are for more than just a cold.

If only I had a pound for every time I’ve heard it: the aim of every successful marketer should be to deliver the right offer to the right customer at the right time. And the role of CRM is to enable you to achieve this goal with ever greater precision.
However, recent thinking suggests that this truism is by no means universally true. Chance, serendipity, and the odd ‘wrong’ offer may have a bigger role in the creation of loyal customers than we ever imagined.
Last week saw the 59th anniversary of the tragic death of the computer pioneer Alan Turing. One of his legacies was a theoretical experiment designed to ascertain whether a computer has achieved what might truly be described as artificial intelligence.
The so-called Turing Test involves putting the computer in one sealed room, and a person in another, linked by some form of two-way communication. If, after a series of conversations, the human believes that he or she is talking to another person and not a machine, the goal of artificial intelligence will have been achieved.
I’ve often thought that a ‘perfect’ CRM programme would pass the Turing Test with ease. The computer would have an uncanny ability to predict and meet the human consumer’s needs, creating an impression of anticipation and care that only flesh and blood can deliver.
For over half a century, experimenters have tried to get their computers to pass the Turing Test. Despite a few near misses, the goal appears as elusive as it did in 1954.
The problem is that computers are very good at managing a relationship based on the subject’s past behaviour. But they lack the ability to mimic something that’s even more human: a talent for serendipity or discovery by happy accident.
Like the test-failing computers, I now realise that CRM is lumbered with the same problem. Driven by statistical regression models, the more perfect CRM becomes, the less capable it will be of helping customers to make fortuitous chance discoveries.
Philosophers and educationists worry that technology such as Google’s personalised search will eliminate serendipity and thus further narrow our minds. Which is all very tragic. But what has it got to do with marketing effectiveness?
Potentially quite a lot, as it happens. According to research by Professor Rebecca Ratner and others at the University of Maryland, a dash of happenchance could boost the returns from your marketing programmes.
In an especially insightful piece of research, Ratner and her colleagues found that subjects often spontaneously choose to do something they know they won’t especially enjoy, even though a preferred alternative is available.
I sometimes find myself doing this on holiday. I know I’d love to spend another day by the pool but instead I drag myself to the local museum for a dose of tedious cultural enrichment.
Ratner theorises that this choice of a less-preferred behaviour is because I subconsciously want to give myself an interesting holiday memory. And as any planner will tell you, memories are what consumers say distinguish great holidays from merely good ones.
But the research reveals another phenomenon that may be of more immediate interest to marketers. Subjects who made the occasional less-preferred choice reported enjoying their usual choice even more, and staying loyal to it for longer.
This seems to fly in the face of traditional CRM logic, which tends to be just about giving the customer more of what they want and broadening their repertoire only very gradually (‘If you liked that, you’ll like this’).
It reminds me of the time a bookseller told me the secret of arranging the perfect gondola end. In summary, it’s this: lay out the best-seller on the bottom tier. On the next tier, display other titles by the same author. And on the top tier, arrange a totally random selection of unrelated titles. The last piece of advice sounded utterly weird at the time, but now I see the sense in it.
The lesson? Variety isn’t just the spice of life. It may also be another way to greater lifetime value.

Google is set to cut about 20 per cent of Motorola’s workforce as it looks to revive the phone maker it acquired earlier this year by focusing on building premium smartphones.
Motorola Mobility is planning to leave unprofitable markets and stop making low end devices as it looks to better compete with the biggest players in the sector Apple and Samsung.
The move will result in about 4,000 job losses, two thirds of which will be outside the US, and the closure of a third of its 94 offices worldwide. Motorola would not be drawn on specifics as to how the cuts will affect the UK or the company’s marketing department when contacted for comment.
Motorola plans to base the bulk of its operations in the US, where it has 11.7 per cent market share of the total feature phone and smartphone handset market, according to comScore data to June. In the UK, Motorola has just a 0.6 per cent share of the smartphone handset market.
It marks Google’s first major strategical impact on Motorola Mobility since it acquired the handset maker for $12.5bn (£7.9bn) in May.
The company ousted Motorola Mobility’s chief executive Sanjay Jha shortly after, replacing him with its own executive Dennis Woodside, who was Google’s president of the Americas region and ad sales lead. Google also announced after the acquisition that 40 per cent of Motorola’s vice president roles will be laid off, which could include senior marketing staff.
Google plans for Motorola to make fewer phones than the 27 it produced last year, which will have “cool” features such as sensors with voice recognition, long lasting batteries and quality cameras.
The innovations will be led from Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects division, which is led by Regina Dugan, who was hired from the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in March this year. The division is recruiting metals scientists, artificial intelligence experts and acoustic engineers to build its new high end smartphones.
Woodside told the New York Times, which had a pre briefing on the announcement: “The Google business is built on a wired model, and as the world moves to a pretty much completely wireless model over time, it’s really going to be important for Google to understand everything about the mobile consumer.”
Budweiser is looking to accelerate its move toward branded entertainment by agreeing to sponsor a Ron Howard directed documentary about rapper Jay-Z’s music festival.
Intel is to launch a series of marketing partnerships with film, travel, fashion and arts brands as it looks to position Ultrabooks as a cool and “bold” category to take on Apple.
Pearson Publishing is to launch its own college offering business degrees developed with brands including BT and Cisco, the first time a FTSE 100 company has directly developed a degree course.
The Advertising Standards Authority is to embark on a charm offensive to try and convince major advertisers it isn’t a “mob” that is “out to get them”.

Struq’s personalised banner ads tackle the problem of ’banner blindness’ and match job seekers with their perfect vacancy.
Imagine that you’re looking for a job. You’ve applied for a whole range of roles in the past week, including PR executive at a fashion start-up, a similar role at an online advertising agency and an intriguing writing proposition for a new media company in Manchester.
Now, sitting in a café with your laptop, catching up with friends on Facebook, shopping on Asos.com, flirting with a guy on Match.com, your eye is caught by a banner ad from Jobsite.
This is no ordinary ad; it appears to be serving up vacancies related to your last visit to the site. Suggesting a PR executive job for a TV station, it is as if the advert has been specially generated just for you and your interests.
This is exactly what Gary Robinson, marketing manager at Jobsite, wants people to feel about his ads. Rather than use traditional online spots, he turned to agency Struq last year to provide something more tailored to individuals and their job-seeking needs.
“We were trying to build our brand awareness and I was skeptical of display advertising because it doesn’t tend to have great clickthrough rates,” says Robinson. “But with Struq banners, you are essentially running a personalised display ad.”
Jobsite was keen to increase the number of conversions for its business in terms of people registering with the site, applying for jobs anduploading CVs. Jobsite aims to reach jobseekers from every sector so it can come up with the goods for every position its recruiter clients are looking to fill.
Struq personalises the content of display ads in real-time to increase the relevance of ads to users and lower the costs for advertisers to acquire customers. The campaign was implemented by putting Struq Site Logic Tags on the jobs website. These are fed into Struq’s data engine, which creates logic about users and a dynamic feed of all the jobs on Jobsite.
Struq then creates ad templates within client brand guidelines which can seamlessly deliver an unlimited number of personalised, relevant and informative ads to users.
Struq shows users what they want to see within an ad, explains Sam Barnett, chief executive of Struq. “We have developed personalised ads that are relevant to users, and relevant advertising content results in users being ten times more likely to engage, click and convert on a display ad.”
Job seekers were engaged by the personalised ads because the campaign used the media that match a specific consumer’s interest, then paired it with the right job, location, wage and offer, in real-time.
“The success behind Struq banners is that a potential candidate will have taken a look at Jobsite then gone off around the internet looking at other stuff they are interested in,” explains Robinson. “They are then presented, via the banners, with jobs they have been looking at and similar ones.”
Jobsite has always been a forward-looking brand, claims Robinson, who has spent 11 years with the company. At the beginning of his career, the employment agency was taking jobs by fax machine and sending out job information to candidates on disc. Tapping into current trends, Jobsite has just launched an iPhone app and will soon be trying other types of mobile technology.
“You have to try these new aspects of technology because there might be a gem in there that is good for your business,” says Robinson. “You can play it safe but you have to take risks to win out.”
Tailored advertising is a natural route for the Jobsite brand, which is very much about making job hunting more personalised. Candidates are given their own criteria for searching and for ways of receiving information on potential jobs including email and Twitter.
“I can get more for my money with this click-through and we noticed that the level of CVs and job applications rocketed through this,” says Robinson. “You are attracting your own audience back and converting them.”
Struq’s Personalised Banners maximised users’ interaction with and response to the Jobsite ads, improving the advertiser’s brand perception through its audience and users’ online experience. In commercial terms, this level of relevance means you are 12 times more likely to click on a banner.
The impact of the personalised ads and the significant increase in relevancy for Jobsite was a substantial improvement in performance. Compared to other types of tools – Run of Network, Standard Retargeting and Behavioural Targeting – the dynamic display adverts delivered 71% of conversions.
Jobsite considers that Struq’s innovative technology helped it attract customers at a lower cost than even search marketing, traditionally seen as the most effective means of acquiring customers for Jobsite. The ad has seen a huge improvement in clickthrough rates, making Jobsite’s advertising costs more efficient. Job well done.
INNOVATOR
VIEWPOINT
SAM BARNETTCEO AND FOUNDERSTRUQ
When explaining that I worked in the banner advertising industry to my mum, she couldn’t understand why I was working in a declining industry as she never saw banner ads anymore.
She said she ignored these ads as they annoyed her and were irrelevant to her, something commonly described as banner blindness. That’s when I realised something had to change: we had to make ads more relevant and informative to significantly improve the user’s online experience.
We began working on Personalised Banner Ads – to make ads truly relevant to users online. When we test-marketed the first ads, the significant increase in relevancy for users resulted in a substantial decrease in the advertiser’s costs to acquire customers.
We effectively delivered Personalised Banner Ads for Jobsite, matching users looking for jobs with roles from Jobsite.co.uk, as they surfed the internet.
 The way we did this was by using a combination of artificial intelligence and psychology to personalise and optimise personalised banner ads.
We create a “DNA” of the user based on what they have been searching for on the Jobsite site. So, if you are female, looking for a certain type of role and salary in a particular area, when you go to browse jobs on the internet, we use a cookie to make ads personal to you.

Cannes: Microsoft Advertising has secured a global partnership deal with Publicis Groupe for a major research project to improve the targeting of online and TV advertising.
The software company’s advertising arm will work closely with Publicis-owned studio PBJS and the Vivaki Nerve Center to help online advertisers and publishers get the best return on investment for their targeted ads.
The deal is initially for one year, effective from August 1, though it is likely to be extended. It will not impact on existing media agency arrangements and will be run from London and Paris.
Speaking exclusively to Marketing Week in the Cannes Lions international advertising festival, Gregg Albright, Microsoft Advertising’s vice president of global accounts, consumer and online, says: “The work coming out of this collaboration will enable advertisers to get the best return on investment for their brand ads through knowing how to optimise content to be the best, ensuring it performs at the optimum level and reaches out to the right audience.”
The deal follows Microsoft Advertising’s sponsorship of The Pool, a VivaKi research initiative that tested new online video ad formats and new digital ad models. The first wave of this research helped to inspire the recent brand refresh of MSN Video, and Albright believes it can help to revolutionise the online ad industry.
Publicis will also help Microsoft test its Navic subsidiary, which uses Admira artificial intelligence technology to track audience intelligence anonymously.
David Kenny, managing partner of VivaKi told Marketing Week: “We will help to pilot this technology in the US towards the end of the year. The system will provide us with enough data to be able to tell television advertisers which programmes are suitable for their ads to be broadcast alongside, and later in real-time track if the audience metrics were right.”
As part of the agreement, Starcom MediaVest Group, Zenith Optimedia and Digitas will be the first agency networks to use the Admira technology to help clients plan and buy media when Admira goes live towards the end of the year. Microsoft hopes to bring Navic to the UK some time next year.
Paramount Home Entertainment UK & Ireland has appointed former Orange head of product management for digital TV, Lesley Henry, as its new marketing director.
According to Marketing Week’s major new study on the ‘Anatomy of a Leader’, modern marketing leaders are focusing on driving strategy and using their skills to champion the next wave of talent, rather than attempting to be brilliant at everything.
